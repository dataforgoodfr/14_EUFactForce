    Mental Health, Discourse and Stigma

    Οlga Zayts-Spence1*, David Edmonds1 and Zoe Fortune1

    Abstract
    In this editorial to the special collection “Mental Health, Discourse and Stigma” we outline the concepts of mental,
    health, discourse and stigma as they are examined through sociolinguistic lenses. We examine the sociolinguistic
    approach to mental health and stigma and discuss the diﬀerent theoretical frameworks and methodological
    approaches that have been applied in such contexts. Sociolinguistics views mental health and stigma as
    discursively constructed and constituted, i.e. they are both manifest, negotiated, reinforced or contested in the
    language that people use. We highlight existing gaps in sociolinguistic research and outline how it could enrich
    research in psychology and psychiatry and contribute to professional practice. Speciﬁcally, sociolinguistics provides
    well-established methodological tools to research the ‘voices’ of people with a history of mental ill health, their
    family, carers and mental health professionals in both online and oﬀ-line contexts. This is vital to develop targeted
    interventions and to contribute to de-stigmatization of mental health. To conclude, we highlight the importance of
    transdisciplinary research that brings together expertise in psychology, psychiatry and sociolinguistics.
    Keywords Mental health, Discourse, Stigma, Sociolinguistics

Introduction
This special collection brings together the three broad
themes of mental health, discourse and stigma as they are
examined through sociolinguistic lenses. We first pres              -
ent what we mean by mental health, discourse and stigma
and discuss the interrelationships between these con                -
cepts. We then offer a brief overview of existing sociolinguistic research on mental health and stigma and identify
continuing areas of under-research that we hope this special collection will contribute to. Finally, we ask the questions of ‘why?’ and ‘so what?’ in relation to sociolinguistic
research on mental health and stigma and outline some
ways in which this growing area of research could meaningfully contribute to broader professional practice in
psychology and psychiatry.

Defining mental health, mental health stigma and
discourse
A range of theoretical frameworks and methodological
approaches have been used to investigate mental health
and stigma across different disciplines, including socio      -
linguistics. Historically, the study of mental health has
been dominated by psychology and psychiatry which
has led to a “psychiatrization” [ 1] of mental health and
illness, approaching the matter from a clinical perspec       -
tive. In this special collection, we adopt the World Health
Organization’s (WHO) encompassing definition of mental health as “a state of mental well-being that enables
people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their
community” [ 2]. The WHO’s description of mental
health acknowledges that “mental health is broader than
the lack of a mental disorder”, and encompasses mental
disorders, psychosocial disabilities, and “other mental
states associated with significant distress, impairment in
functioning, or risk of self-harm” [ 2]. This definition also

emphasizes the close interrelationship between mental
health and social aspects of life.
Closely intertwined with the concept of mental health
is the concept of stigma that has also been widely
researched in psychology, psychiatry, as well as sociol       -
ogy. In his seminal essay, sociologist Erving Goffman [       3]
defines stigma as “an attribute that is deeply discrediting”.
Stigmatized individuals are often perceived as being dif      -
ferent and “lesser” than “the normals” [ 3]. Contemporary
definitions of mental health stigma largely follow Goff       -
man’s work, highlighting its discrediting attributes and
the negative attitudes attached to it [4, 5]. These attitudes
also extend to people in the immediate surroundings,
such as family [ 6], and even mental health professionals
[7, 8]. This is known as associative or courtesy stigma,
i.e. being stigmatized because of a relationship to an
individual experiencing a mental health problem [             9].
Long describes associative stigma experienced by men          -
tal health professionals who are stigmatized because of
being “attached to their patients and […] positioned as
a less prestigious branch of a broader medical profes         -
sion” [7]. Shipman and Zayts discuss an extreme case of
such associative stigma where a psychiatrist practising in
Hong Kong is stigmatized by his own family for working
with mentally ill people and for fear of ‘transmission’ of a
mental illness [8].
Psychological research on mental health stigma has
burgeoned since Goffman’s study. Focusing on the
“micro-level social interactions”, this research has exam     -
ined the causes of stigma, its cognitive dimensions, the
consequences and the coping responses [     10, 11]. Fewer
sociological studies existed [ 10], but following a muchcited publication by Link and Phelan [      12], sociological
research has proliferated. Link and Phelan re-defined
stigma, surmising it to four processes: labelling differ      -
ences, stereotyping differences, separating the stigma        -
tized from ‘us’, and discriminating against the stigmatized
[12]. By highlighting the processes of discrimination and
separation of the stigmatized from ‘us’, Link and Phelan
essentially expanded the definition of stigma to the
macro-level social processes, such as social inequality,
discrimination based on one’s mental health status, and
discriminating societal ideologies. These macro-social
forms of stigma are known as structural stigma [            11].
Workplace settings are one example when employers
are hesitant to hire or promote people with a history of
mental health problems, although these discriminatory
attitudes are typically subtle and indirect. Sociological
research has largely focused on how different types of
stigma contribute to inequalities and impact social rela      -
tionships between different groups [10].
Sociolinguistics studies the interrelationship between
language and society [ 13] of which discourse is a cen        -
tral sociolinguistic concept. It is equally as nebulous and
multifaceted as the concepts of mental health and stigma.
Discourse may refer to:
 –   A stretch of language above a clause or a sentence
     level [14].
 –   Language used by speakers to covey and negotiate
     certain meanings and achieve particular purposes
     [15].
 –   Language used to represent various social practices,
     social actors and ideologies [16, 17].
Relating these different interpretations of discourse to
mental health contexts, in its micro-analytic understanding discourse may refer, for example, to negative ste        -
reotypical attributes, such as ‘mad’, ‘crazy’, and  ‘insane’.
Culturally, there exist striking differences in how mental
health disorders are described, although negative con        -
notations typically prevail. For example, the term          精神
分裂症 in Chinese (jīng-shén-fēn liè zhèn         ɡ, schizophrenia) has a literal translation of ‘the split-mind disease’.
This term is heavily stigmatizing. Substantial efforts have
been made by mental health professionals in Hong Kong
to introduce less stigmatizing terms, such as    思覺失調
(sī jué shī tiáo, psychosis) that translates as ‘thought and
perceptual dysregulation’ [18].
   In relation to discourse as ‘language-in-use’, the following example from an interview with a psychiatrist illus      -
trates how the diagnosis of a ‘schizophrenic patient’ is
used to account for the tragic event of mass killing that
has marked, in this psychiatrist’s words, “a milestone”
in the development of psychiatric services in Hong
Kong. It is an objectivized, ‘clinical’ account of a men     -
tal health disorder and its impact on one’s behaviour. It
also highlights a wider societal impact in response to the
recounted incident.

Example 1 Psy – psychiatrist; I – interviewer.
 6.  Psy: Yes. The most well known in Hong Kong is
     this 1982 tragedy […] Schizophrenic patient, young
     man killed his mother and sister at home [.] and
     then went down with two knives and entered a
     kindergarten and killed four more.
 11.I:  Children?
 12.Psy: Four kids and wounded forty something.
     […] This incident created, it may be regarded as
     a milestone for the development of the service,
     because after this incident all the society turned
     attention to mental health, mental patients.
 The last approach to discourse foregrounds how men          -
tal health is constructed through social practices. Mental
health and mental health stigma are “socially and dis        -
cursively constituted” [ 19] with a bidirectional relation   -
ship between discourse and social practices. Crudely
speaking, discourse is the ‘mirror’ through which social
practices and ideologies become evident. For example,
different linguistic choices, such as the use of derogative,


direct or figurative language to talk about mental health,
reflect the dominant societal practice and ideologies. In
the reverse, ways of communicating about mental health
impact social practices and ideologies. One example
could be media portrayals of mental health as both a
reflection of prevalent societal ideologies and ways to
impact them. These different conceptualizations of dis        -
course have been employed in sociolinguistic studies of
mental health and mental health stigma.

Sociolinguistic research on mental health and mental
health stigma
In this special collection, we use the term sociolinguistics
broadly to include linguistic approaches and method               -
ologies as diverse as corpus linguistics, different types of
discourse analysis (e.g. thematic and critical), conversa         -
tion analysis, narrative inquiry, to name just a few. While
these approaches conceptualise discourse differently,
most sociolinguistic studies on mental health and men             -
tal health stigma take a social constructivist view, viewing
language as a means of constructing social reality. Socio-linguistic studies include quantitative, qualitative and
mixed methods studies. They examine diverse discourse
data, from interactions in clinical contexts, to online
interactions between members of mental health support
groups, to large media corpora. Each of these different
types of data provides insights into different aspects of
mental health and has both strengths and limitations.
Arguably, one of the most potent sociolinguistic
approaches to mental health research to date has been
corpus linguistics [ 19–23]. Corpus linguistics refers to
methods that use computerized tools (e.g. Wordsmith,
Sketch Engine) to analyse large collections of data (cor          -
pora). While the corpus size could be substantial, the use
of tools allows consistent and fairly easy identification
of patterns in the data [  1]. Another common sociolin            -
guistic approach is critical discourse analysis (CDA) [       24,
25]. For example, Price uses corpus linguistics and CDA
to interrogate news reports on mental health in the UK
from 1984 to 2014 [  26]. Substantial corpus data delve
into media’s portrayals of mental health, and how mental
health stigma is created and perpetuated by media.
Notably, sociolinguistic research often includes the
‘voices’ of under-represented, vulnerable or under-researched demographic groups. For example, Galinsky’s
and colleagues’ research focuses on discourses surrounding male depression and suicide [ 27–29]. Societal ideologies around men as strong and powerful often stop men
from seeking help and opening up about their mental
health struggles. Sociolinguistic research has much to
contribute to elucidating these dominant ideologies and
support organizations targeting men’s mental health
(e.g. Mind UK or Manup). It could also contribute to
understanding groups ‘associated’ with people with a
history of mental ill health. For example, Ziółkowskaa
and Galasiński, examine the narratives of children of
fathers who died by suicide and how they deal with both
bereavement of their deceased parent and the stigma
attached to death by suicide [29].
These are just a few examples of previous and ongo           -
ing sociolinguistic research, and in this special col        -
lection we welcome contributions that apply different
theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches
in sociolinguistics.

The ‘why?’ and the ‘so what?’ of sociolinguistic research on
mental health and mental health stigma
This brief overview of sociolinguistic research points to
some of the possible applications of research to profes      -
sional practice. Sociolinguistic research focuses on dis     -
courses of mental health. These discourses are powerful,
they are the means to talk about mental health, the locale
where mental health issues are manifest, the means to
seek and offer help, and the ways to offer education and
develop interventions. They are also the means to chal       -
lenge and contest negative ideologies. De-stigmatisation
of mental health can be achieved through structural
changes (e.g. offering equal employment opportunities)
but most, if not all, social activities and practices are
mediated through language. Therefore, sociolinguis           -
tic research continues to make a strong contribution to
mental health de-stigmatization, research and practice.
There is an increasing emphasis in psychology and
psychiatry on participatory research, including with
vulnerable demographic groups [   30]. As this editorial
emphasizes, a strength of current sociolinguistic research
is that it investigates the ‘voices’ of different groups of
people affected by mental ill health. Established sociolinguistic approaches (e.g. narrative inquiry, rhetorical dis   -
course analysis) provide tools to examine different types
of accounts for the social actions that people perform,
why and when people give accounts, and the language
that they use when they do it. Investigating these data is
important to develop targeted interventions for different
groups of people affected by mental ill health.
Sociolinguistic research also ‘weaves together’ the
micro-interactions with other contexts, the meso (e.g.
institutional) and the macro (societal), bringing personal
and the social aspects of mental health together to pro      -
vide a more holistic picture.
Our brief overview has identified research gaps. There
remains a paucity of empirical sociolinguistic research
that uses real-life interactional data in face-to-face
communicative encounters in mental health contexts,
for example, in counselling or psychotherapy encoun          -
ters. This may be partly due to ethical considerations of
access and the use of sensitive data (for exceptions, see,
for example, Lavie and Nakash) [  31]. Examining these


types of data allows exploring in detail how social actions                           Conflict of interest
