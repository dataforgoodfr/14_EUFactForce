Effective correction of misinformation
Toby Prike and Ullrich K. H. Ecker
Abstract
This paper reviews correction effectiveness, highlighting which
factors matter, which do not, and where further research is
needed. To boost effectiveness, we recommend using detailed
corrections and providing an alternative explanation wherever
possible. We also recommend providing a reminder of the initial
misinformation and repeating the correction. Presenting corrections pre-emptively (i.e., prebunking) or after misinformation
exposure is unlikely to greatly impact correction effectiveness.
There is also limited risk of repeating misinformation within a
correction or that a correction will inadvertently spread misinformation to new audiences. Further research is needed into which
correction formats are most effective, whether boosting correction
memorability can enhance effectiveness, the effectiveness of
discrediting a misinformation source, and whether distrusted
correction sources can contribute to corrections backfiring.

Misinformation can have negative impacts for both individuals and societies [1,2]. For example, misinformation has contributed to vaccine hesitancy, resistance to
public-health measures, and negative political outcomes such as reduced satisfaction with democracy
[3e7]. Therefore, it is important to identify and
implement effective interventions. Several such interventions, which rely on a variety of underlying strategies, have been identiﬁed. For example, interventions
such as accuracy prompts and social norms use a nudging
approach,
interventions
involving
media-literacy
training aim to boost misinformation detection, and
warning labels or corrections debunk misinformation
(see Ref. [8]). This brief review focuses on this last
approach, the effective correction of misinformation.
Effective correction of misinformation
Providing a correction is a natural response to encountering a piece of information one ﬁnds to be false.
Corrections are broadly applicable as they can vary in
speciﬁcity and detail depending on how much is known
about the misinformation being corrected and its falsity.
However, compared to other interventions, corrections
have the disadvantage that they are generally designed
to be (1) employed retroactively and (2) speciﬁc to the
particular misinformation they target. The retroactive
nature of corrections presents a challenge because if a
recipient has already formed a false belief based on the
misinformation, undoing this belief requires cognitively
challenging processes of memory updating or knowledge
revision [1]. Together with the need for speciﬁcity, this
means that in environments awash with misinformation,
a corrective approach will face challenges of scale. Thus,
if corrections were the only tool available, countering
misinformation would truly be a Sisyphean task. However, the speciﬁcity of corrections also enhances inter-vention salience; that is, correction recipients will
typically know exactly which claim is being challenged.
Thus, corrections have generally been found to be at
least somewhat effective at reducing false beliefs and
reliance on misinformation [9,10]. Therefore, corrections are a crucial tool for countering misinformation,
particularly misinformation with the potential for harm.
What makes a correction effective
Fortunately, the correction of misinformation has been
widely studied, allowing for the identiﬁcation of several
key considerations for designing effective corrections
(see Table 1). Firstly, providing an alternative, factual
explanation wherever possible increases the effectiveness of corrections (e.g., Ref. [1]). This is a well-established ﬁnding, and including an alternative explanation is likely to be particularly important when
correcting causal misinformation (e.g., the cause of an
accident or health problem). Several recent papers
provide insight into why providing alternative explanations enhances correction effectiveness. Susmann and
Wegener [11] found that retracting misinformation induces psychological discomfort, and this discomfort is

associated with continued reliance on misinformation
post-correction. This is consistent with the idea that
one beneﬁt of providing an alternative explanation is
that it allows people to maintain a complete mental
model of an event, situation, or causal relation, thereby
reducing discomfort associated with an incomplete
mental model [1]. Kendeou et al. [12] used a thinking
aloud paradigm and found that while reading a correction with an alternative explanation, participants re-ported increased cognitive conﬂict and monitoring.
However, when subsequently reading the corrected
outcome, participants had faster reading times, lower
cognitive conﬂict and monitoring, and made more accurate elaborations, suggesting a correction containing
an explanation leads to greater integration of the
correction and reduced misinformation reactivation,
thereby enhancing knowledge revision.
Although providing an alternative explanation is bene-
ﬁcial, it is not always possible or applicable (e.g., when
no factual alternative information is currently available,
or in cases of non-causal misinformation). However,
providing additional details within a correction is nearly
always possible (e.g., details about why the misinformation is false, or why it may be believed or spread), and
this is also a well-established strategy for enhancing the
effectiveness
corrections,
as
conﬁrmed by a recent meta-analysis [9]. Beneﬁts of
providing additional details have also been found in the
context of corrections related to public health [15] and
even when using corrections during crisis communication [14]. Recent research from our own lab has found
that providing additional details increases the longevity
of correction effects, even when using short-format
corrections (i.e., less than 140 characters; [13]).
Another recommendation is to repeat misinformation
corrections. Repetition can enhance memory for the
correction and thereby alleviate belief regressiondthe
tendency for misinformation belief to creep back up
over time as the correction fades in memory [18].
Repetition of corrections may be particularly useful if
recipients are distracted when they encounter the
correction, with recent research ﬁnding that when participants are under cognitive load, multiple retractions
are needed for corrections to be effective [17]. There is
also a growing body of evidence that placing a reminder
of the speciﬁc piece of misinformation being corrected
within or alongside a correction can help to enhance
correction effectiveness [20,21,23]. This beneﬁcial
effect of reminders may stem from enhanced clarity and
salience, allowing recipients to more easily co-activate
the correction and the targeted misinformation in
memory [1,12].
The previously listed recommendations all relate to
features of corrections, but source factorsdand particularly the trustworthiness of the correction sourcedare
also important for ensuring correction effectiveness.
Several papers have shown that the credibility of
correction sources matters, with ofﬁcial organizations
and socially connected sources leading to increased
correction efﬁcacy [25,28,29]. Recent work has further
investigated correction source credibility by disentangling the impacts of expertise and trustworthiness,
showing that source trustworthiness is more impactful
than expertise, and that corrections from untrusted
sources may even be entirely ineffective [26,27].
What not to worry about
Just as important as identifying factors that do impact
correction effectiveness is identifying factors that have
limited impact so that researchers and practitioners can
focus their efforts elsewhere. The timing of corrections
and the ordering of correction elements is one such
factor. With news headlines, there is some evidence
that it is beneﬁcial to present corrective fact-checks
(i.e., ‘false’ tags) after headline exposure rather than
before [57]. On social media, fact-focused corrections
(but not corrections that expose misleading logic) may
also be more effective when presented after misinformation exposure [61]. However, several other recent
studies found similar levels of correction effectiveness
regardless of whether the correction occurred before
(i.e.,
prebunking)
or
after
exposure [22,59,60].
Moreover,
the
speciﬁc
ordering
correction
elementsdwhether a correction is presented in a ‘mythfact’, a ‘fact-myth’, or a ‘truth sandwich’ (‘fact-mythfact’) formatddoes not seem to affect efﬁcacy much,
with various formats appearing to be equally effective at
correcting
[22,58]. Likewise, many

more-peripheral presentation features seem to have no
or negligible impact on correction effectiveness. For
example, Fazio et al. [35] found that providing visual
information indicating the type of misinformation being
corrected (e.g., manufactured vs. manipulated) and the
number of news organizations endorsing the correction
were poorly remembered by participants and provided
no beneﬁt.
Thus, cumulatively the evidence suggests that corrections are likely to be similarly effective regardless of
presentation order or secondary presentation features,
and that pre-emptively presenting corrections (i.e.,
prebunking) can be an effective alternative to traditional retroactive corrections in situations where future
misinformation exposure can be foreseen.
A longstanding concern has been that repeating misinformation within a correction may be counterproductive
and lead to a familiarity backﬁre effect, whereby
misinformation repetition ironically increases false beliefs post-correction due to a boost to misinformation
familiarity (see Ref. [50], for discussion). However, evidence continues to accumulate against familiarity
backﬁre
effects.
As
aforementioned,
reminders
misinformation within a correction help rather than
hinder. Multiple studies have also found that corrections
that contain both ‘myth’ and ‘fact’ are superior to ‘factonly’ interventions that aim to correct a misconception
by focusing only on the facts [19,22,24]. Even with
explicit misinformation repetition under conditions
conducive to familiarity effects, recent studies have
failed to ﬁnd evidence for familiarity backﬁre [13,16].
Some have argued that familiarity backﬁre may be a
particular risk when a correction of novel misinformation
is presented without prior misinformation exposure
[55]. However, recent studies from our lab have found
that even without initial misinformation exposure, corrections are unlikely to backﬁre [46,56]. Cumulatively,
we believe that the evidence shows there is limited risk
of familiarity backﬁre effects and that even the correction of novel misinformation is unlikely to backﬁre.
What might matter
In addition to the factors mentioned above, there are
several factors that may impact correction effectiveness
for which there is not yet enough evidence to draw ﬁrm
conclusions. One emerging research question is whether
including a discreditation of a misinformation source
within a correction can enhance effectiveness. There is
some evidence that reducing trust in a misinformation
source can lead to reduced misinformation reliance [33]
and recent work conducted within our lab found that
discrediting a misinformation source (e.g., highlighting a
conﬂict of interest) can enhance a correction and also
reduce misinformation reliance on its own [31]. However,
in
other
studies,
telling
participants
that
misinformation originated from an intentional lie or a
website that creates false stories provided no additional
beneﬁt over a standard correction [30,32]. These results
may suggest that a strong and explicit source discreditation is needed for it to provide additional beneﬁt over
and above a standard correction.
Another area that has received considerable attention is
correction format and medium. Pasquetto et al. [28]
reported that audio corrections were more effective than
image or text-based corrections on WhatsApp (possibly
because they created more interest), but the observed
difference was small. Ecker, Sharkey et al. [16] found
that only a format juxtaposing ‘myths’ and ‘facts’ was
effective at reducing vaccine-related misconceptions,
whereas other formats, including a simple ‘false tag’, a
fear appeal, and even a detailed visual correction format
(comprehension of which may have required more
attention than participants gave it), were ineffective.
Challenger et al. [19] found that when correcting
COVID-19 misinformation, a ‘question-answer’ format
was more effective than a ‘fact-myth’ format, but only
after a delay, and only marginally so. Several studies have
also suggested there are beneﬁts to using a narrative
format or adding narrative elements to a correction
[52,54,55]. However, when narrative corrections are
contrasted with similarly detailed non-narrative corrections, there does not appear to be any beneﬁt of narrative [51,53,56]. Overall, there is mixed evidence
regarding which correction formats are most effective,
and many studies confound correction format and provision of details. Further research is needed to examine
whether some formats and/or elements consistently lead
to improved correction efﬁcacy when other factors are
controlled for.
A somewhat surprising recent ﬁnding is that conducting
memory tests after a correction led to enhanced memory
of correction details after a 1-week delay but did not
impact correction effectiveness [35,54]. This is particularly noteworthy given that correction memory has
been found to negatively correlate with post-correction
misinformation reliance, and memory failure is a proposed mechanism by which correction efﬁcacy fades
over time [18,35]. Future research should further
explore the relationship between memory and correction efﬁcacy and examine whether there are methods for
boosting correction memory that transfer to reduced
misinformation reliance.
Another area of ongoing research relates to the impact of
worldview on misinformation corrections. Many recent
studies have shown that corrections of political misinformation are effective even if the misinformation is
consistent with a participant’s worldview and/or comes
from a politically aligned source [42e44,47,51]. However, some studies have found that corrections are less
Correcting Misinformation Prike and Ecker

effective if they challenge a strongly held belief or
require attitudinal change [45,49,53]. Additionally, a
recent paper found that even though corrections were
effective overall, some individuals were more prone to
increasing misinformation belief in response to a
correction, particularly when the correction source was a
political outgroup [48]. Work in our own lab has also
recently shown that corrections can be ineffective and
may even backﬁre if people are skeptical of the correction source [46]. However, it is important to note that
the risk of both familiarity and worldview-driven back-
ﬁre effects is likely much lower than once thought, and
backﬁre effects are less likely to occur when reliable
(multi-item) measures of misinformation belief are used
[52]. Therefore, future research should further examine
if backﬁre effects reliably occur when people are sufﬁciently
distrustful
or
skeptical
a
correction
source [41,52].
Conclusion
There is considerable evidence about how to enhance
correction effectiveness and which factors have little
impact. Providing an alternative explanation and/or more
details will boost correction efﬁcacy, as will providing a
reminder of the initial misinformation and repeating the
correction. Whether the correction is presented before
(i.e., as a prebunking) or after misinformation exposure
is unlikely to greatly impact correction effectiveness.
There is also limited risk of repeating misinformation
within a correction or that a correction will inadvertently
spread
to
new
audiences.
Further
research is needed into which correction formats are
most effective, and whether the beneﬁts seen for some
formats are simply due to providing additional details.
The research into boosting memory for corrections has
hitherto found relatively little beneﬁt, but given the
link between correction memory and effectiveness over
time, further research in this area is warranted. Source
trust is also a promising area for future research,
including further examination of the effectiveness of
source discreditation, as well as whether distrust and/or
skepticism of a correction source can contribute to
corrections backﬁring.

why correction effectiveness wanes over time, this paper quantified the
extent to which memory failure accounts for belief regression and
recommended that future research examine strategies for making
corrections more memorable.

This paper found that corrections generally do not backfire, even when
they are presented without initial misinformation exposure. Also found
that standalone corrections may backfire if participants are sufficiently
skeptical of the correction source.

associated with reliability. J Exp Psychol Gen 2022, 151:
1655–1665, https://doi.org/10.1037/xge0001131.
This paper found that both familiarity and worldview backfire effects are
more likely to occur when items have low reliability. This finding helps to
explain the low replicability of backfire effects, and recommends that
future research uses more reliable measures.
