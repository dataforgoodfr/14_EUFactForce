    Effective correction of misinformation
    Toby Prike and Ullrich K. H. Ecker

Abstract
This paper reviews correction effectiveness, highlighting which
factors matter, which do not, and where further research is
needed. To boost effectiveness, we recommend using detailed
corrections and providing an alternative explanation wherever
possible. We also recommend providing a reminder of the initial
misinformation and repeating the correction. Presenting corrections pre-emptively (i.e., prebunking) or after misinformation
exposure is unlikely to greatly impact correction effectiveness.
There is also limited risk of repeating misinformation within a
correction or that a correction will inadvertently spread misinformation to new audiences. Further research is needed into which
correction formats are most effective, whether boosting correction
memorability can enhance effectiveness, the effectiveness of
discrediting a misinformation source, and whether distrusted
correction sources can contribute to corrections backfiring.

training aim to boost misinformation detection, and
warning labels or corrections debunk misinformation

approach, the effective correction of misinformation.

Effective correction of misinformation
Providing a correction is a natural response to encountering a piece of information one ﬁnds to be false.
Corrections are broadly applicable as they can vary in
speciﬁcity and detail depending on how much is known
about the misinformation being corrected and its falsity.
However, compared to other interventions, corrections
have the disadvantage that they are generally designed
to be (1) employed retroactively and (2) speciﬁc to the
particular misinformation they target. The retroactive

Although providing an alternative explanation is bene-
ﬁcial, it is not always possible or applicable (e.g., when
no factual alternative information is currently available,
or in cases of non-causal misinformation). However,
providing additional details within a correction is nearly
always possible (e.g., details about why the misinformation is false, or why it may be believed or spread), and
this is also a well-established strategy for enhancing the
effectiveness          of     misinformation         corrections,
conﬁrmed by a recent meta-analysis [9]. Beneﬁts of
providing additional details have also been found in the
context of corrections related to public health [15] and
even when using corrections during crisis communication [14]. Recent research from our own lab has found
that providing additional details increases the longevity
of correction effects, even when using short-format
corrections (i.e., less than 140 characters; [13]).
       that it is beneﬁcial to present corrective fact-checks
       (i.e., ‘false’ tags) after headline exposure rather than
       before [57]. On social media, fact-focused corrections
       (but not corrections that expose misleading logic) may
       also be more effective when presented after misinformation exposure [61]. However, several other recent
       studies found similar levels of correction effectiveness
       regardless of whether the correction occurred before
as     (i.e.,  prebunking)    or  after  misinformation   exposure [22,59,60].
       Moreover,    the   speciﬁc    ordering  of    correction
       elementsdwhether a correction is presented in a ‘mythfact’, a ‘fact-myth’, or a ‘truth sandwich’ (‘fact-mythfact’) formatddoes not seem to affect efﬁcacy much,
       with various formats appearing to be equally effective at
       correcting misinformation   [22,58].    Likewise,   many


more-peripheral presentation features seem to have no
or negligible impact on correction effectiveness. For
example, Fazio et al. [35] found that providing visual
information indicating the type of misinformation being
corrected (e.g., manufactured vs. manipulated) and the
number of news organizations endorsing the correction
were poorly remembered by participants and provided
no beneﬁt.

Thus, cumulatively the evidence suggests that corrections are likely to be similarly effective regardless of
presentation order or secondary presentation features,
and    that pre-emptively presenting corrections        (i.e.,
prebunking) can be an effective alternative to traditional retroactive corrections in situations where future
misinformation exposure can be foreseen.

A longstanding concern has been that repeating misinformation within a correction may be counterproductive
and    lead   to a familiarity backﬁre effect, whereby
misinformation repetition ironically increases false beliefs post-correction due to a boost to misinformation
familiarity (see Ref. [50], for discussion). However, evidence   continues   to accumulate against         familiarity
backﬁre     effects.  As aforementioned, reminders      of
misinformation within a correction help rather than
hinder. Multiple studies have also found that corrections
that contain both ‘myth’ and ‘fact’ are superior to ‘factonly’ interventions that aim to correct a misconception
by focusing only on the facts [19,22,24]. Even with
explicit misinformation   repetition   under        conditions
conducive to familiarity effects, recent studies have
failed to ﬁnd evidence for familiarity backﬁre [13,16].
Some have argued that familiarity backﬁre may be a
particular risk when a correction of novel misinformation
is presented     without prior misinformation         exposure
[55]. However, recent studies from our lab have found
that even without initial misinformation exposure, corrections are unlikely to backﬁre [46,56]. Cumulatively,
we believe that the evidence shows there is limited risk
of familiarity backﬁre effects and that even the correction of novel misinformation is unlikely to backﬁre.

What might matter
In addition to the factors mentioned above, there are
several factors that may impact correction effectiveness
for which there is not yet enough evidence to draw ﬁrm
conclusions. One emerging research question is whether
including a discreditation of a misinformation source
within a correction can enhance effectiveness. There is
some evidence that reducing trust in a misinformation
source can lead to reduced misinformation reliance [33]
and recent work conducted within our lab found that
discrediting a misinformation source (e.g., highlighting a
conﬂict of interest) can enhance a correction and also
reduce misinformation reliance on its own [31]. However,  in     other   studies,  telling  participants     that
misinformation originated from an intentional lie or a
website that creates false stories provided no additional
beneﬁt over a standard correction [30,32]. These results
may suggest that a strong and explicit source discreditation is needed for it to provide additional beneﬁt over
and above a standard correction.

Another area that has received considerable attention is
correction format and medium. Pasquetto et al. [28]
reported that audio corrections were more effective than
image or text-based corrections on WhatsApp (possibly
because they created more interest), but the observed
difference was small. Ecker, Sharkey et al. [16] found
that only a format juxtaposing ‘myths’ and ‘facts’ was
effective at reducing vaccine-related misconceptions,
whereas other formats, including a simple ‘false tag’, a
fear appeal, and even a detailed visual correction format
(comprehension of which may     have required more
attention than participants gave it), were ineffective.
Challenger et  al. [19] found   that when     correcting
COVID-19 misinformation, a ‘question-answer’ format
was more effective than a ‘fact-myth’ format, but only
after a delay, and only marginally so. Several studies have
also suggested there are beneﬁts to using a narrative
format or adding narrative elements to a correction
[52,54,55]. However, when narrative corrections are
contrasted with similarly detailed non-narrative corrections, there does not appear to be any beneﬁt of narrative  [51,53,56].  Overall, there is  mixed evidence
regarding which correction formats are most effective,
and many studies confound correction format and provision of details. Further research is needed to examine
whether some formats and/or elements consistently lead
to improved correction efﬁcacy when other factors are
controlled for.

A somewhat surprising recent ﬁnding is that conducting
memory tests after a correction led to enhanced memory
of correction details after a 1-week delay but did not
impact correction effectiveness [35,54]. This is particularly noteworthy given that correction memory has
been found to negatively correlate with post-correction
misinformation reliance, and memory failure is a proposed mechanism by which correction efﬁcacy fades
over  time [18,35]. Future  research  should     further
explore the relationship between memory and correction efﬁcacy and examine whether there are methods for
boosting correction memory that transfer to reduced
misinformation reliance.

Another area of ongoing research relates to the impact of
worldview on misinformation corrections. Many recent
studies have shown that corrections of political misinformation are effective even if the misinformation is
consistent with a participant’s worldview and/or comes
from a politically aligned source [42e44,47,51]. However, some studies have found that corrections are less


effective if they challenge a strongly held belief or                 References

This paper found that one of the primary reasons that the effectiveness
of corrections reduces over time is because of reduced memory for the
correction. Although memory failure is often a presumed explanation of
why correction effectiveness wanes over time, this paper quantified the
extent to which memory failure accounts for belief regression and
recommended that future     research examine strategies for      making
corrections more memorable.

This paper found that corrections in an audio format generated greater
interest and were more effective than text or image-based corrections
on a closed social-media platform. Additionally, the results showed that
participants were more likely to reshare corrections that came from
sources with strong social ties and shared political beliefs, highlighting
the importance of social connection for enhancing correction efficacy.

This paper examined correction formats and whether retrieval practice
can help to maintain correction effectiveness after a delay. The results
showed that phrasing corrections as a question vs. a negation and
including images indicating the extent to which a piece of misinformation is false did not boost correction efficacy. Additionally, retrieval
practice led to greater memory for article details but did not lead to
increased correction effectiveness.
