Ecker\nAbstract\nThis paper reviews correction effectiveness, highlighting which\nfactors matter, which do not, and where further research isneeded. To boost effectiveness, we recommend using detailedcorrections and providing an alternative explanation whereverpossible. We also recommend providing a reminder of the initialmisinformation and repeating the correction. Presenting correc-tions pre-emptively (i.e., prebunking) or after misinformationexposure is unlikely to greatly impact correction effectiveness.There is also limited risk of repeating misinformation within a\ncorrection or that a correction will inadvertently spread misinfor-\nmation to new audiences. Further research is needed into whichcorrection formats are most effective, whether boosting correctionmemorability can enhance effectiveness, the effectiveness ofdiscrediting a misinformation source, and whether distrustedcorrection sources can contribute to corrections backfiring.\nAddresses\nSchool of Psychological Science, University of Western Australia,Perth, Australia\nCorresponding author: Prike, Toby ( toby.prike@uwa.edu.au )\nCurrent Opinion in Psychology 2023, 54:101712\nThis review comes from a themed issue on The Psychology of Misin-\nformation (2024)\nEdited by Gordon Pennycook andLisa K.

For example, misinforma-\ntion has contributed to vaccine hesitancy, resistance topublic-health measures, and negative political out-comes such as reduced satisfaction with democracy[3e7]. Therefore, it is important to identify and\nimplement effective interventions. Several such in-terventions, which rely on a variety of underlying stra-tegies, have been identiﬁed. For example, interventionssuch as accuracy prompts and social norms use a nudgingapproach, interventions involving media-literacy\ntraining aim to boost misinformation detection, andwarning labels or corrections debunk misinformation(see Ref. [ 8]). This brief review focuses on this last\napproach, the effective correction of misinformation.\nEffective correction of misinformation\nProviding a correction is a natural response to encoun-tering a piece of information one ﬁnds to be false.Corrections are broadly applicable as they can vary inspeciﬁcity and detail depending on how much is knownabout the misinformation being corrected and its falsity.However, compared to other interventions, correctionshave the disadvantage that they are generally designedto be (1) employed retroactively and (2) speciﬁc to theparticular misinformation they target. The retroactivenature of corrections presents a challenge because if a\nrecipient has already formed a false belief based on the\nmisinformation, undoing this belief requires cognitivelychallenging processes of memory updating or knowledgerevision [ 1]. T ogether with the need for speciﬁcity, this\nmeans that in environments awash with misinformation,a corrective approach will face challenges of scale. Thus,if corrections were the only tool available, counteringmisinformation would truly be a Sisyphean task. How-ever, the speciﬁcity of corrections also enhances inter-vention salience; that is, correction recipients willtypically know exactly which claim is being challenged.\nThus, corrections have generally been found to be at\nleast somewhat effective at reducing false beliefs andreliance on misinformation [ 9,10]. Therefore, correc-\ntions are a crucial tool for countering misinformation,particularly misinformation with the potential for harm.\nWhat makes a correction effective\nFortunately, the correction of misinformation has beenwidely studied, allowing for the identiﬁcation of severalkey considerations for designing effective corrections(see Table 1 ). Firstly, providing an alternative, factual\nexplanation wherever possible increases the effective-ness of corrections (e.g., Ref. [ 1]). This is a well-\nestablished ﬁnding, and including an alternative expla-\nnation is likely to be particularly important whencorrecting causal misinformation (e.g., the cause of anaccident or health problem). Several recent papersprovide insight into why providing alternative explana-tions enhances correction effectiveness. Susmann andWegener [ 11] found that retracting misinformation in-\nduces psychological discomfort, and this discomfort is\nAvailable online at www.sciencedirect.com\nScienceDirect\nwww.sciencedirect.com Current Opinion in Psychology 2023, 54:101712"}, {"page": 2, "text": "associated with continued reliance on misinformation\npost-correction. This is consistent with the idea thatone beneﬁt of providing an alternative explanation isthat it allows people to maintain a complete mental\nmodel of an event, situation, or causal relation, thereby\nreducing discomfort associated with an incompletemental model [ 1]. Kendeou et al. [ 12] used a thinking\naloud paradigm and found that while reading a correc-tion with an alternative explanation, participants re-ported increased cognitive conﬂict and monitoring.However, when subsequently reading the correctedoutcome, participants had faster reading times, lowercognitive conﬂict and monitoring, and made more ac-curate elaborations, suggesting a correction containingan explanation leads to greater integration of the\ncorrection and reduced misinformation reactivation,\nthereby enhancing knowledge revision.\nAlthough providing an alternative explanation is bene-\nﬁcial, it is not always possible or applicable (e.g., whenno factual alternative information is currently available,or in cases of non-causal misinformation). However,providing additional details within a correction is nearlyalways possible (e.g., details about why the misinfor-mation is false, or why it may be believed or spread), andthis is also a well-established strategy for enhancing the\neffectiveness of misinformation corrections, as\nconﬁrmed by a recent meta-analysis [ 9]. Beneﬁts of\nproviding additional details have also been found in thecontext of corrections related to public health [ 15] and\neven when using corrections during crisis communica-tion [ 14]. Recent research from our own lab has found\nthat providing additional details increases the longevityof correction effects, even when using short-formatcorrections (i.e., less than 140 characters; [ 13]).Another recommendation is to repeat misinformation\ncorrections. Repetition can enhance memory for thecorrection and thereby alleviate belief regression dthe\ntendency for misinformation belief to creep back upover time as the correction fades in memory [ 18].\nRepetition of corrections may be particularly useful ifrecipients are distracted when they encounter thecorrection, with recent research ﬁnding that when par-\nticipants are under cognitive load, multiple retractions\nare needed for corrections to be effective [ 17]. There is\nalso a growing body of evidence that placing a reminderof the speciﬁc piece of misinformation being correctedwithin or alongside a correction can help to enhancecorrection effectiveness [ 20,21,23]. This beneﬁcial\neffect of reminders may stem from enhanced clarity andsalience, allowing recipients to more easily co-activatethe correction and the targeted misinformation inmemory [ 1,12].\nThe previously listed recommendations all relate to\nfeatures of corrections, but source factors dand partic-\nularly the trustworthiness of the correction source dare\nalso important for ensuring correction effectiveness.Several papers have shown that the credibility ofcorrection sources matters, with ofﬁcial organizationsand socially connected sources leading to increasedcorrection efﬁcacy [ 25,28,29]. Recent work has further\ninvestigated correction source credibility by disen-tangling the impacts of expertise and trustworthiness,showing that source trustworthiness is more impactful\nthan expertise, and that corrections from untrusted\nsources may even be entirely ineffective [ 26,27].\nWhat not to worry about\nJust as important as identifying factors that do impact\ncorrection effectiveness is identifying factors that havelimited impact so that researchers and practitioners canfocus their efforts elsewhere. The timing of correctionsand the ordering of correction elements is one suchfactor. With news headlines, there is some evidencethat it is beneﬁcial to present corrective fact-checks(i.e., ‘false’ tags) after headline exposure rather thanbefore [ 57]. On social media, fact-focused corrections\n(but not corrections that expose misleading logic) may\nalso be more effective when presented after misinfor-\nmation exposure [ 61]. However, several other recent\nstudies found similar levels of correction effectivenessregardless of whether the correction occurred before(i.e., prebunking) or after misinformation expo-sure [ 22,59,60].\nMoreover, the speciﬁc ordering of correction\nelements dwhether a correction is presented in a ‘myth-\nfact’, a ‘fact-myth’, or a ‘truth sandwich’ (‘fact-myth-fact’) format ddoes not seem to affect efﬁcacy much,\nwith various formats appearing to be equally effective at\ncorrecting misinformation [ 22,58]. Likewise, manyTable 1\nOverview of factors that do, do not, and might impact correction\neffectiveness.\nFactor Impact on\nEffectivenessRelevant\nEvidence\nProvide an alternative\nexplanationYes [ 11,12]\nProvide details Yes [ 9,13–16]\nRepeat the correction Yes [ 17,18]\nMisinformation reminder Yes [ 19–24]\nTrustworthy correction\nsourceYes [ 25–29]\nDiscredit misinformation\nsourceLikely [ 30–33]\nCorrection format Possible [ 19,28,34–40]\nWorldview congruence Possible [ 41–53]\nCorrection retrieval practice Unlikely [ 35,54]\nMisinformation repetition\nwithin correctionUnlikely [ 16,20,21,24,46,\n50,52,55,56]\nPresentation order Unlikely [ 22,57–61]2The Psychology of Misinformation (2024)\nCurrent Opinion in Psychology 2023, 54:101712 www.sciencedirect.com"}, {"page": 3, "text": "more-peripheral presentation features seem to have no\nor negligible impact on correction effectiveness. Forexample, Fazio et al. [ 35] found that providing visual\ninformation indicating the type of misinformation beingcorrected (e.g., manufactured vs. manipulated) and thenumber of news organizations endorsing the correctionwere poorly remembered by participants and providedno beneﬁt.\nThus, cumulatively the evidence suggests that correc-\ntions are likely to be similarly effective regardless ofpresentation order or secondary presentation features,and that pre-emptively presenting corrections (i.e.,prebunking) can be an effective alternative to tradi-tional retroactive corrections in situations where futuremisinformation exposure can be foreseen.\nA longstanding concern has been that repeating misin-\nformation within a correction may be counterproductive\nand lead to a familiarity backﬁre effect, whereby\nmisinformation repetition ironically increases false be-liefs post-correction due to a boost to misinformationfamiliarity (see Ref. [ 50], for discussion). However, ev-\nidence continues to accumulate against familiaritybackﬁre effects. As aforementioned, reminders ofmisinformation within a correction help rather thanhinder. Multiple studies have also found that correctionsthat contain both ‘myth’ and ‘fact’ are superior to ‘fact-only’ interventions that aim to correct a misconceptionby focusing only on the facts [ 19,22,24]. Even with\nexplicit misinformation repetition under conditions\nconducive to familiarity effects, recent studies havefailed to ﬁnd evidence for familiarity backﬁre [ 13,16].\nSome have argued that familiarity backﬁre may be aparticular risk when a correction of novel misinformationis presented without prior misinformation exposure[55]. However, recent studies from our lab have found\nthat even without initial misinformation exposure, cor-rections are unlikely to backﬁre [ 46,56]. Cumulatively,\nwe believe that the evidence shows there is limited riskof familiarity backﬁre effects and that even the correc-tion of novel misinformation is unlikely to backﬁre.\nWhat might matter\nIn addition to the factors mentioned above, there areseveral factors that may impact correction effectivenessfor which there is not yet enough evidence to draw ﬁrmconclusions. One emerging research question is whetherincluding a discreditation of a misinformation sourcewithin a correction can enhance effectiveness. There is\nsome evidence that reducing trust in a misinformation\nsource can lead to reduced misinformation reliance [ 33]\nand recent work conducted within our lab found thatdiscrediting a misinformation source (e.g., highlighting aconﬂict of interest) can enhance a correction and alsoreduce misinformation reliance on its own [ 31]. How-\never, in other studies, telling participants thatmisinformation originated from an intentional lie or a\nwebsite that creates false stories provided no additionalbeneﬁt over a standard correction [ 30,32]. These results\nmay suggest that a strong and explicit source discred-itation is needed for it to provide additional beneﬁt overand above a standard correction.\nAnother area that has received considerable attention is\ncorrection format and medium. Pasquetto et al. [ 28]\nreported that audio corrections were more effective thanimage or text-based corrections on WhatsApp (possiblybecause they created more interest), but the observeddifference was small. Ecker, Sharkey et al. [ 16] found\nthat only a format juxtaposing ‘myths’ and ‘facts’ waseffective at reducing vaccine-related misconceptions,whereas other formats, including a simple ‘false tag’, afear appeal, and even a detailed visual correction format(comprehension of which may have required moreattention than participants gave it), were ineffective.\nChallenger et al. [ 19] found that when correcting\nCOVID-19 misinformation, a ‘question-answer’ formatwas more effective than a ‘fact-myth’ format, but onlyafter a delay, and only marginally so. Several studies havealso suggested there are beneﬁts to using a narrativeformat or adding narrative elements to a correction[52,54,55]. However, when narrative corrections are\ncontrasted with similarly detailed non-narrative correc-tions, there does not appear to be any beneﬁt of narra-tive [ 51,53,56]. Overall, there is mixed evidence\nregarding which correction formats are most effective,\nand many studies confound correction format and pro-\nvision of details. Further research is needed to examinewhether some formats and/or elements consistently leadto improved correction efﬁcacy when other factors arecontrolled for.\nA somewhat surprising recent ﬁnding is that conducting\nmemory tests after a correction led to enhanced memoryof correction details after a 1-week delay but did notimpact correction effectiveness [ 35,54]. This is partic-\nularly noteworthy given that correction memory hasbeen found to negatively correlate with post-correction\nmisinformation reliance, and memory failure is a pro-\nposed mechanism by which correction efﬁcacy fadesover time [ 18,35]. Future research should further\nexplore the relationship between memory and correc-tion efﬁcacy and examine whether there are methods forboosting correction memory that transfer to reducedmisinformation reliance.\nAnother area of ongoing research relates to the impact of\nworldview on misinformation corrections. Many recentstudies have shown that corrections of political misin-\nformation are effective even if the misinformation is\nconsistent with a participant’s worldview and/or comesfrom a politically aligned source [ 42e44,47,51]. How-\never, some studies have found that corrections are lessCorrecting Misinformation Prike and Ecker 3\nwww.sciencedirect.com Current Opinion in Psychology 2023, 54:101712"}, {"page": 4, "text": "effective if they challenge a strongly held belief or\nrequire attitudinal change [ 45,49,53]. Additionally, a\nrecent paper found that even though corrections wereeffective overall, some individuals were more prone toincreasing misinformation belief in response to acorrection, particularly when the correction source was apolitical outgroup [ 48]. Work in our own lab has also\nrecently shown that corrections can be ineffective and\nmay even backﬁre if people are skeptical of the correc-\ntion source [ 46]. However, it is important to note that\nthe risk of both familiarity and worldview-driven back-ﬁre effects is likely much lower than once thought, andbackﬁre effects are less likely to occur when reliable(multi-item) measures of misinformation belief are used[52]. Therefore, future research should further examine\nif backﬁre effects reliably occur when people are sufﬁ-ciently distrustful or skeptical of a correctionsource [ 41,52].\nConclusion\nThere is considerable evidence about how to enhance\ncorrection effectiveness and which factors have littleimpact. Providing an alternative explanation and/or moredetails will boost correction efﬁcacy, as will providing a\nreminder of the initial misinformation and repeating the\ncorrection. Whether the correction is presented before(i.e., as a prebunking) or after misinformation exposureis unlikely to greatly impact correction effectiveness.There is also limited risk of repeating misinformationwithin a correction or that a correction will inadvertentlyspread misinformation to new audiences. Furtherresearch is needed into which correction formats aremost effective, and whether the beneﬁts seen for someformats are simply due to providing additional details.The research into boosting memory for corrections hashitherto found relatively little beneﬁt, but given the\nlink between correction memory and effectiveness over\ntime, further research in this area is warranted. Sourcetrust is also a promising area for future research,including further examination of the effectiveness ofsource discreditation, as well as whether distrust and/orskepticism of a correction source can contribute tocorrections backﬁring.\nDeclaration of competing interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competingﬁnancial interests or personal relationships that couldhave appeared to inﬂuence the work reported inthis paper.\nData availability\nNo data was used for the research described inthe article.\nAcknowledgement\nUKHE is supported by the Australian Research Council\n(grant FT190100708).References\nPapers of particular interest, published within the period of review,\nhave been highlighted as:\n* of special interest\n* * of outstanding interest\n1\n**.
