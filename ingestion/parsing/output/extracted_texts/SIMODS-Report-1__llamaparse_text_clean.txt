    Disinformation in Europe
    on Very Large Online Platforms

    First report of the SIMODS project
Structural Indicators to Monitor Online
     Disinformation Scientif ically

Executive Summary

The consortium led by Science Feedback and including Newtral, Demagog SK, Pravda,
Check First, and the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) completed the first large-scale,
cross-platform, scientifically sound measurement of Structural Indicators of Disinformation.
These indicators assess how permeable Very Large Online     Platforms (VLOPs)   are to
misinformation and disinformation in Europe, how influential repeat misinformers       are
relative to credible sources, and the extent to which such content is monetised.

Amid debate over the Code of Conduct on Disinformation, now becoming a co-regulatory
instrument under the DSA, and     partial disengagement     by some VLOPs       from their
commitments, this report offers comparable, evidence-based measurement to inform policy
and enforcement.

WHAT WE MEASURED
Across six VLOPs (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, X/Twitter, YouTube) and four EU
Member States    (France, Poland, Slovakia, Spain), we report four Structural   Indicators:
Prevalence of  mis/disinformation; Sources (relative influence of repeat misinformers  vs.
credible actors); Cross-platform presence; and Monetisation.

Datasets studied were     either platform-provided (LinkedIn) or the result of large-scale
keyword  searches  on high-salience  topics (Ukraine/Russia,   climate, health, migration,
national politics). The corpus   covers ~2.6 million posts totalling ~24 billion views.  A
view-weighted random sample (500 posts per platform and per country) approximates
widely seen content; professional fact-checkers annotated posts to assess misinformation.

Data access note.  Despite DSA Article 40.12 requests, only LinkedIn
supplied the requested random sample; TikTok granted API access too late
for inclusion in this wave. This underscores persistent access gaps affecting
independent audits.

KEY FINDINGS
1) Prevalence. TikTok shows the highest prevalence of mis/disinformation  (~20% of
exposure-weighted posts). Facebook (~13%) and X/Twitter (~11%) follow; YouTube
and Instagram are at ~8%; LinkedIn is at ~2%.
When including abusive (e.g., hate speech) and borderline content (content supporting
a disinformation narrative without making a verifiably false claim), both of which


     contribute to a less-informed public debate, prevalence      rises to ~34% on TikTok,
     ~32% on X/Twitter, ~27% on Facebook, ~22% on YouTube, ~19% on Instagram, and
     ~8% on LinkedIn.

         2) Sources – “misinformation premium”. Accounts that repeatedly share misinformation
     (low-credibility) attract more engagement per post per 1 000 followers than credible
     (high-credibility) accounts on all platforms except LinkedIn.
     The ratio (low/high) is most pronounced on       YouTube (~8×) and Facebook (~7×); it is
     ~5×  on Instagram and X/Twitter, and ~2×     on TikTok.      This  indicates  systematic
     amplification advantages for recurrent misinformers. Only on LinkedIn is this premium
     absent, meaning that sharers of misinformation are not rewarded with extra visibility
     there.

   3) Cross-platform footprint. Low-credibility actors are more likely than high-credibility
     actors to  maintain accounts  on X/Twitter (+34%), Facebook        (+23%),   and TikTok
     (+17%); the inverse holds for LinkedIn (-80%) and Instagram (-33%).

   4) Monetisation. None of the assessed services fully prevents monetisation by recurrent
     misinformers.        On YouTube, ~76% of eligible low-credibility channels are monetised
     (vs. ~79% for high-credibility). On Facebook, ~20% of eligible low-credibility Pages
     appear monetised (vs. ~60% for high-credibility). Google Display Ads appear on 27%
     of   low credibility websites (vs. ~70% for  high-credibility).    Transparency   limits
     prevented equivalent auditing on X/Twitter, TikTok, LinkedIn, and Instagram.

WHY THIS MATTERS
Under the DSA’s systemic-risks framework, platforms must reduce the spread and impact
of misleading   content   and avoid incentivising it  financially. Our  results   show that
misleading content is prevalent across  platforms, recurrent misinformers  benefit     from a
persistent engagement premium, and demonetisation is not fully operational, especially on
YouTube.   These   patterns are inconsistent with  an online      environment   that reliably
privileges trustworthy information.

LIMITATIONS AND NEXT STEPS
This wave reflects a first collection period (first half of 2025) and constrained data access
on some services. A second measurement will be published in early 2026 to track changes
over time.    Future iterations should benefit from   improved    platform data   access and
expanded monetisation coverage as Article 40 of the DSA requires platform cooperation.


1. Introduction

Many    platforms have recently stepped back from earlier commitments          to counter
disinformation, for instance by reducing fact-checking programmes, staffing    in      relevant
teams, or specific pledges. These policy shifts have been widely reported since early 2025
and are often framed as responses to political pressure in the United States.

Some claim that   platforms  are saturated with misinformation, while others argue that
misleading content constitutes only a small fraction of users’ exposure[¹⁻²]. This ambiguity
underscores the need for robust, comparable measurement so debates, and any resulting
regulation spearheaded in Europe, are anchored in evidence rather than assertion.

1.1 THE CODE OF CONDUCT ON DISINFORMATION
The Code of Conduct on Disinformation (formerly the Code of Practice) is a co-regulatory
instrument   co-developed by the European  Commission  with     online platforms, search
engines, the advertising industry, fact-checkers and civil society. Signatories commit to a set
of  measures including (among    others) promoting trustworthy  sources,     reducing the
amplification of misleading content, demonetising disinformation, increasing transparency
of political advertising, partnering with fact-checkers, and enabling researcher access to
data[³].

On 13 February 2025,   the   Commission and the European  Board for    Digital Services
formally integrated the 2022 Code into the Digital Services Act (DSA) framework, turning it
into  the Code of Conduct on Disinformation. As of 1 July 2025, the Code is operational
under the DSA, with auditing and compliance mechanisms, meaning that the Code has
become a “significant  and meaningful benchmark for    determining compliance          with the
[DSA]”[⁴].

1.2 STRUCTURAL INDICATORS
The concept of Structural Indicators was first introduced in the Commission’s Guidance on
Strengthening the Code of Practice on Disinformation, which called for Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs) to track both implementation and effectiveness of the Code. These KPIs
are  structured into two complementary sets: Service-level Indicators, which assess the
results and impact of specific policies; and Structural Indicators, which evaluate the broader
systemic impact of the Code.

In response to this guidance, the European Digital Media Observatory (EDMO), specifically
through the work of the Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom (CMPF), developed


an initial set of Structural Indicators aimed at capturing the evolution and characteristics of
online disinformation over time[⁵].

EDMO proposed indicators comprising a core set including: Prevalence of disinformation,
Sources of disinformation, Audience of disinformation, and Collaboration and investments
in  fact-checking, and an extended     set  including Users’    resilience,      Demonetisation,
Cross-platform disinformation, and Algorithmic amplification[⁶].

To compare how permeable each platform is to misleading content and how welcoming it is
for actors spreading it, indicators           must be defined in a way that is comparable across
platforms and stable over time so that progress, or deterioration, can be quantified.

It  is  with this objective that   the SIMODS    (Structural Indicators to  Monitor  Online
Disinformation    Scientifically) project was designed: to   provide independent,       external
measurement of key Structural      Indicators and assess whether platforms respect users’
rights to be informed truthfully and not manipulated and comply with the EU framework.

1.3 SIMODS
SIMODS (Structural Indicators to Monitor Online Disinformation Scientifically) is a project
led by Science Feedback, in partnership with the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC),
Check   First, and fact-checking   organisations Newtral, Demagog SK, and Pravda.            The
project measures four Structural Indicators:

    1)  Prevalence of Disinformation;
    2)  Sources of Disinformation;
    3)  Monetization of Disinformation;
    4)  Cross-platform Aspects of Disinformation.

Measurements cover six Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs) and four countries: France,
Poland, Slovakia and Spain. Under the DSA, a VLOP is designated at ≥45 million average
monthly active recipients in the EU (≈10% of the EU population).

This European Media and Information Fund (EMIF)-funded project spans 18 months. This
report presents the first measurement period; a second measurement and follow-up report
will be published in early 2026.

While previous attempts have been made to measure Structural Indicators, most notably
TrustLab’s pilot implementation[⁷,⁸], they did not deliver a full prevalence metric, in part due
to    limited data collection scale. Indeed, it is not an easy feat to collect data at the scale
required to produce meaningful and statistically robust results.


Despite the DSA’s data-access provisions for researchers (Article 40), most platforms did
not provide datasets in time for our analysis following our requests. Only LinkedIn provided
the random sample that we requested, and TikTok granted API access too late for inclusion
in this data-collection period.

SIMODS succeeds in delivering these measurements on Structural Indicators through an
approach that:

    •  relies    on large-scale datasets, which allows our results to be representative of
contents that are highly viewed on each platform;
    •  rely   on professional  fact-checkers to  assess whether each   piece     of content
contains mis/disinformation, as they possess the most relevant expertise for this task given
their experience through their daily work identifying and debunking false claims;
    •  applies rigorous protocols and statistical analysis, reviewed by UOC researchers
within the consortium.

NOTE: WHY THE TERM MIS/DISINFORMATION?
The Code uses the term “disinformation” to cover “verifiably false or misleading information
that is created, presented, and disseminated for economic gain or to intentionally deceive
the public, and that may cause public harm”.

This functional definition encompasses what is traditionally termed misinformation (false or
misleading information spread unintentionally) and disinformation (misinformation spread
intentionally). In this report, we apply the Code’s definition when assessing content but use
the shorthand “mis/disinformation” to avoid  ambiguity  and make       explicit  that both
intentional and unintentional false or misleading content are included.


2. Findings

2.1 PREVALENCE of MIS/DISINFORMATION
The first and most direct indicator of the scale of the disinformation issue on a platform is
its  prevalence, that is, the proportion of the content that users are exposed to on the
platform that contains mis/disinformation.

As EDMO explains, prevalence “aims to measure how widespread disinformation is across
platforms. As such, the share of content identified as disinformation in a selected sample of
random content should be  measured”[⁶].   In reaction to EDMO’s 2nd report, a group of
experts who provided feedback on structural indicators further explained that prevalence
should   be measured      “by comparing it  to  content on similar topics rather than          all
non-disinformation content”[⁹].

With this background information, we set out to measure prevalence consistently across
the six very large online platforms. To do so, we collected hundreds of thousands of pieces
of   content on topics that are central to  the public debate in Europe and at high risk of
carrying mis/disinformation and asked professional fact-checkers to determine which posts
contained mis/disinformation.

It  is          important to note that previous attempts to measure prevalence, such as TrustLab’s
2023 pilot, were unable to construct a reliable measure of prevalence due to the limited
scale of their data collection. Instead, TrustLab’s study produced a metric of “discoverability”
(or    “findability”),  i.e.  the share of  mis/disinformation among   search results          for
disinformation-related        keywords[⁷,⁸]. While valuable, this metric reflects  what users find
when they explicitly search for problematic content, rather than what they are incidentally
exposed  to  in         their  everyday browsing. Our approach    represents      a significant
methodological advance: it allows us to construct large, representative samples of content
that   reflect actual   user   exposure,     thereby producing    the first robust cross-platform,
cross-country measure of prevalence.

2.1.1 Data Collection & Processing

A. KEYWORDS-BASED SEARCH
To   approximate the information environment that users           encounter, we built our corpus
through keyword searches          on topics  of high public interest  in Europe and high risk of
mis/disinformation: the Russia-Ukraine war, climate change, health, migration, and national
politics.


To minimize bias and allow meaningful comparison across countries, most keywords were
translated identically across the four languages of the study. This was notably the case for
Ukraine,  climate, health, and migration topics. In contrast, local politics      keywords were
adapted to the national context in each country to ensure relevance.

In order not to bias our sampling towards mis/disinformation only, and to properly capture
the diversity of content users are exposed to on platforms, the keyword lists, tested and
designed by professional fact-checkers, included keywords in these three categories:

•         Neutral  terms   (e.g. Zelensky, migrants, Covid-19): widely used  across all
information  sources,  ensuring  that our   dataset included  mainstream     reporting      and
discussion.

•         Ambiguous   terms (e.g. vaccine  side  effects,     geoengineering, laboratories in
Ukraine): terms often encountered in misleading narratives but that are not specific to it and
also legitimately used in scientific or journalistic contexts.

       •  Misinformation-related  terms    (e.g. climate scam, Ukrainian Nazi,    remigration):
that are predominantly used in false or misleading claims and are unlikely to be used by
credible sources when speaking about the topic.

The final list of search terms included around 100 keywords per language (French, Spanish,
Polish,   Slovak) and was  balanced,  with equal    numbers    of neutral and ambiguous       +
misinformation-related terms in each country. More details            about the keywords can be
found in Appendix 5.1.1. The first data collection period spanned 17 March to 13 April, and
we collected posts that are published between these dates (inclusive).

To collect          data from the selected platforms, we employed two different methods. First,
given that this project investigates a systemic risk (under DSA Article 34) to civic discourse,
we invoked Article 40.12 of the DSA and contacted all six VLOPs on 19 December 2024 to
request a random sample of 200 000 posts per language. As only LinkedIn provided the
requested dataset, we relied on a second method for the other platforms, using their search
functions         and associated tools to retrieve large numbers of posts containing any of our
keywords of interest. More details on the tools, filters, and procedures used can be found in
Appendix 5.1.1.

As a result, for   the entire data collection period,         we assembled a dataset comprising
approximately 2.6 million posts (with metadata) across four languages and six platforms,
totaling around 24 billion views. Given the varied contexts in which keywords can appear,
the dataset still  contained irrelevant content such as celebrity gossip, entertainment, or
sports news. To address this, we used a Large Language Model (LLM), GPT 4o-mini, to
filter the corpus, retaining only posts relevant to our study, that is, content contributing to


public discourse on the state of the world, such as health, science, politics, climate change,
or other societal issues with a direct impact on people’s lives or understanding of society.
More details are provided in Appendix 5.1.2.

B. RANDOM SAMPLE
From this corpus, we then drew a random sample of 500 posts per platform and country for
annotation by   fact-checkers. A crucial methodological        aspect is that sampling  was
weighted by the number of views. For instance, a video with 1 million views was 100
times more likely to appear in our sample than one with 10 000 views. This weighting
ensures that the annotated sample reflects what users are actually seeing, not just what
platforms return in search. It also  mitigates potential distortions:    if a platform’s search
algorithm systematically downranks low-credibility content,           a highly viewed misleading
post would still have a high probability of being sampled. More details on sampling are
provided in Appendix 5.1.2.

C. ANNOTATION
With the random samples prepared, professional fact-checkers annotated each post to
determine whether it contained mis/disinformation.

While our primary focus was distinguishing mis/disinformation (as defined in the Code of
Conduct on Disinformation) from credible information, real-world content doesn’t always fit
neatly into a binary classification. Pilot tests conducted before the annotation period led us
to define a broader set of categories to capture nuance:

•  Mis/disinformation:         Content  stating or clearly     implying  a  verifiably false  or
misleading claim that may cause public harm.
•  Credible      and informative:    Content    conveying  true or    credible information    on
important matters about the state of the world (excluding trivia, gossip, or anecdotes).
•  Borderline: Content feeding a misleading narrative without necessarily containing
outright falsehoods, but potentially reinforcing false beliefs.
•  Abusive: Content not containing mis/disinformation but involving harmful material
such as hate speech, insults, spam, or incitement to harmful behaviour.
•  Unverifiable:     Content   that      cannot    be   assessed      as    either  credible  or
mis/disinformation (e.g. opinion-based).
•  Irrelevant:      Content    not about public affairs   or   scientific/political issues (e.g.
entertainment,  sports,  religious   content,   cooking  recipes   without     health    claims,
geographically irrelevant to Europe).


•  Other language: Content not in one of the languages spoken in the targeted
country or English.
•  Deleted: Content unavailable at the time of annotation (e.g. removed from the
platform).
•  Don’t know: Content not fitting any other category.

annotated as belonging to each of the main categories.


For the analysis, items labelled Irrelevant, Other language, Deleted, and Don’t know were
excluded. See Figure 2.1 for an illustration of the type of posts that were labeled in each of
the main categories.

To ensure the robustness of our findings, each country had one fact-checker annotate the
full dataset (500 posts per platform), while a second fact-checker independently reviewed
a random subset of 100 posts per platform. Where content was labelled Don’t know, the
second fact-checker systematically reviewed it, and their judgment was retained. Once the
data sample was fully labeled, the two fact-checkers discussed cases where discrepancies
between the labels occurred and agreed on a final label for each piece of content.

This cross-verification was critical as it allowed us to account for       the uncertainty and
inevitable degree of subjectivity inherent in any annotation task. All results       presented
below include confidence intervals that quantify the uncertainties coming from both the
sample size and   the   inter-annotator disagreement. Further details on annotation and
confidence intervals can be found in Appendix 5.1.4.

Once the data was processed and annotated by fact-checkers as outlined above, we were
able to quantify the prevalence of posts belonging to each category.

A. PREVALENCE ACROSS CATEGORIES
Figure 2.2 shows an overview of the content breakdown across the six platforms, using the
merged  datasets from   the four countries. The first observation   is that the combined
Credible and Unverifiable categories represent the majority of content on all platforms. We
argue that these categories represent content that    is legitimate to find on platforms.
Credible content is intended to inform users on important matters regarding politics, health,
science, etc., while Unverifiable content typically reflects people’s opinions, commentaries,
and thoughts about news and world events.

The distribution of Credible content is not uniform across platforms, with LinkedIn having
the highest proportion at 59%, and X/Twitter having the lowest at only 27%. However,
content that is  generally  harmful to users or society  (the combination   of  Abusive,
Borderline, and Mis/disinformation, which we collectively refer to as “Problematic” content
in the rest of this analysis) can be found across all platforms. The share of Problematic
content varies by platform, with TikTok and X/Twitter showing the highest levels at 34%
and 31.5%, respectively.


F igure 2.2 – Percentage of posts belonging to each category for the six very large online platforms.

When comparing only Credible to Problematic content, we note that X/Twitter contains
more Problematic content (31.5%) than Credible content (27%), while this is not the case
for the other platforms (see Figure 5.2).

B. PREVALENCE OF MIS/DISINFORMATION
To assess the prevalence of mis/disinformation as   required by the Code of Conduct on
Disinformation, we calculated the ratio of content containing mis/disinformation compared
to legitimate content on similar topics.

We define the prevalence metric 𝑃𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑜 as:

𝑃  =                                    𝑁         𝑁𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑜    × 100
𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑜                           𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑜+𝑁𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑑+𝑁𝑢𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑓

where 𝑁𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑜, 𝑁𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑑 and 𝑁𝑢𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑓 are the numbers of posts labeled as Mis/disinformation,
Credible, and Unverifiable, respectively.

Figure 2.3 presents the values for the prevalence of mis/disinformation across platforms,
using the merged dataset combining the four countries.

The results show significant differences between platforms:


       •     TikTok exhibits the highest prevalence of mis/disinformation  at approximately
    20% [17.7%, 22.6%], indicating that roughly one in five posts on the platform regarding the
    topics we investigated contains misleading or false information.
       •     Facebook and X/Twitter follow with elevated prevalence at 13% [11.5%, 15.4%]
    and 11% [9.0%, 12.2%], respectively.
       •     YouTube and Instagram have a prevalence of about 8%.
       •     LinkedIn has the lowest prevalence of mis/disinformation at    2% [1.3%, 3.2%],
    suggesting that exposure to misinformation on this platform is limited.

    The confidence intervals displayed on the figure and mentioned in the text measure the
    uncertainty of our estimates; they measure both the uncertainty due to   the size of our
    random   samples and  the uncertainty due to    the labeling    of content and potential
    disagreements between fact-checkers (see Appendix 5.1.4. for details). For those interested
    in measuring the proportion   of all  potentially  misleading   content (including both
    Mis/disinformation and Borderline content ), refer to Appendix 5.1.5.B.

F igure 2.3 – Prevalence of mis/disinformation across the six very large platforms, aggregated
  across all languages. The error bars represent the 95% confidence intervals measuring the
uncertainty around each estimate, calculated using a bootstrapping method (See Appendix 5.1.4
    for details).


 Platform    Prevalence [CI 95%]
 LinkedIn      2.3% [1.3, 3.2]
Instagram      8.0% [6.4, 9.4]
 Facebook     13.4% [11.5, 15.4]
    YouTube    8.5% [6.9, 10.2]
  TikTok      20.2% [17.7, 22.6]
X/Twitter      10.6% [9, 12.2]

Table 2.1 – Prevalence of mis/disinformation across the six very large platforms, aggregated across all
 languages (same values as on Figure 2.3). The confidence intervals (CIs) indicate the lower and upper
   bounds within which 95% of the estimates from the bootstrap calculation lie (See Appendix 5.1.4).

    When considering all posts labelled Mis/disinformation, the topic with the highest share is
    health,  representing 43.4% (Figure 2.4). The Russia-Ukraine war is the second most
    represented topic, with about one quarter of Mis/disinformation posts, followed by national
    politics (15.5%), which typically includes election-related claims in the country of interest
    or controversies surrounding new legislation, for instance. Climate and migration        each
    account for 6.6% of Mis/disinformation posts.

    our study.


C. PREVALENCE OF PROBLEMATIC CONTENT
Beyond content containing mis/disinformation, we have explained above that Borderline
and Abusive content should also                     be considered to contribute                                         to a less-informed public
debate and not be confused with informative content. We propose adding their prevalence
to the one of Mis/disinformation to                 create an indicator of                                              the prevalence of harmful, or
“problematic”, content.

We calculate the prevalence of Problematic content 𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏 as:

                                        𝑃  =       𝑁  𝑁𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑜+𝑁𝑏𝑜𝑟𝑑+𝑁𝑎𝑏𝑢𝑠         × 100
                                        𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏        𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑜+𝑁𝑏𝑜𝑟𝑑+𝑁𝑎𝑏𝑢𝑠+𝑁𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑑+𝑁𝑢𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑓

where    𝑁𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑜, 𝑁𝑏𝑜𝑟𝑑,  𝑁𝑎𝑏𝑢𝑠, 𝑁𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑑 and 𝑁𝑢𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑓 are           the numbers              of posts labeled as
Mis/disinformation, Borderline, Abusive, Credible, and Unverifiable, respectively.

Figure 2.5 shows that the prevalence of Problematic content is significantly higher than the
prevalence of Mis/disinformation on all platforms.

With this metric,          both TikTok and                     X/Twitter appear as the platforms with the highest
prevalence of Problematic content, with prevalence values of 34% [31.7%, 36.5%] and
32% [29.9%, 34.1%], respectively (the overlapping confidence intervals indicate that the
values for these two platforms are not statistically different ). This means that roughly one
in three posts on these platforms either contains false or misleading information, includes
abusive language, reinforces                      misleading narratives,            or                                promotes other forms of harmful
content.                                                                     Facebook ranks third with 27% [24.3%, 29.1%], followed by YouTube at 22%
[20.0%,  24.5%],           and Instagram            with       18% [16.8%,                        20.9%].               LinkedIn, as in previous
analyses, reports the lowest prevalence at 7.5% [6.0%, 9.2%], indicating a comparatively
safer information environment.

2.2 SOURCES of MIS/DISINFORMATION
A pervasive      issue     that         has       been frequently        identified               by researchers              and civil society
working on disinformation is that the most influential content is often produced or amplified
by a limited set of actors who recurrently share misleading information. A small number of
highly  influential        accounts         can largely        shape the            spread of misleading narratives                     on a
platform[¹⁰,¹¹], and accounts that share mis/disinformation at a given point in time tend to
continue doing so in the future[¹²].

To effectively measure the health of the information ecosystem on online platforms, it is
crucial to examine the ability of these recurrent mis/disinformation sources to reach and
influence large audiences. Furthermore, comparing the reach of these sources to that of


    credible accounts provides insight into the platform's role in amplifying harmful content.
    The Code of Conduct on Disinformation encourages platforms to prioritize content from
    trustworthy sources while reducing the prominence of misleading or harmful content.

    F igure 2.5 – Prevalence of Problematic content (defined by the grouping of Mis/disinformation,
Borderline and Abusive content ) across the six very large platforms, aggregated across all languages.
The error bars represent the 95% confidence intervals measuring the uncertainty around each estimate,
              calculated using a bootstrapping method (See Appendix 5.1.4 for details).

    Platform    Prevalence [CI 95%]
 LinkedIn         7.5% [6.0, 9.2]
    Instagram    18.8% [16.8, 20.9]
 Facebook        26.8% [24.3, 29.1]
 YouTube         22.4% [20.0, 24.5]
  TikTok         34.1% [31.7, 36.5]
X/Twitter        32.0% [29.9, 34.1]
Table 2.2 - Prevalence of Problematic content across the six very large platforms, aggregated across all
 languages (same values as on Figure 2.5). The confidence intervals (CIs) indicate the lower and upper
   bounds within which 95% of the estimates from the bootstrap calculation lie (See Appendix 5.1.4).

    To assess the effectiveness of the Code, the second Structural Indicator recommended by
    EDMO consists of measuring the characteristics and behaviors of accounts that repeatedly
    share mis/disinformation and comparing them to those of credible sources[⁶]. In response,
    our consortium developed metrics to compare the size of accounts' followings, their activity,


and the engagement their content receives across platforms. We propose using the average
number of interactions per post per follower as a core structural indicator to estimate the
relative influence of different sets of actors. This metric measures how much each platform
helps amplify content from sources of misleading information compared to credible sources,
while accounting for differences in their follower counts. We provide more details below.


To contrast the engagement of misinformation spreaders with that of credible sources, we
used two approaches to identify a list of accounts belonging to the two categories.

A. The Top 50 List Approach
One approach involved identifying the 50 most influential accounts on each platform and
language based on the sample collected for the Prevalence section (Section 2.1). Accounts
were ranked in descending order based on the cumulative number of views their content
received in the dataset collected during the data collection period (March 17 – April 13).
After excluding accounts that mostly shared content deemed irrelevant according to the
project's definition (see    Appendix 5.2.2 for details), we retrieved all posts published by
these accounts during the same period, along with metadata such as the number of likes,
comments, shares, and followers.

From this, we identified accounts that repeatedly shared mis/disinformation and those that
were credible sources.    Recognizing that not all accounts fit  neatly into these        two
categories, we introduced a third category for accounts that do not belong to either group,
such as those primarily sharing opinion-based content.

The categories used were:

   •      Low-credibility: Accounts that shared at least two posts containing      false   or
misleading information.
   •      High-credibility:  Accounts that  almost    exclusively  shared credible        and
informative news, such as content from professional media outlets or scientific institutions.
   •      Neither: Accounts that did not fit into the two categories above, often sharing
opinion-based content.

Fact-checkers in our consortium determined which category each account belonged to. To
assist in the classification process, we used a Large Language Model (LLM), GPT 4o-mini,
to classify posts based on their likelihood of belonging to the Mis/disinformation, Credible,
or Unverifiable categories (as defined in the Prevalence section). Fact-checkers had access
to this initial classification, which helped speed up the process, but the final     decision


remained with the fact-checkers (see Section 5.2.2 for details on how we used an LLM for
this task).

B. The Fact-Checkers' List Approach
Another approach involved asking fact-checkers to provide a list of accounts they know are
frequent sources of misinformation and those they consider trustworthy, based on their
day-to-day fact-checking activities. This list was developed independently of the Top 50
list. The fact-checkers’ list typically included social media accounts frequently flagged for
spreading false or misleading claims in their routine work. We also relied on the Consensus
Credibility Scores, which aggregate multiple open-source credibility ratings for over 20 000
domains, to identify influential social media accounts associated with high or low credibility
sources[¹³].

C. Comparison and Merging of the Two Lists
Upon comparing   the two lists, we noted that the low-credibility   and high-credibility
sources from both datasets partially overlapped, giving a first indication of the robustness
of the lists created. More importantly, we found consistent results on the average number
of interactions  per post per 1 000 followers for the low-credibility     and high-credibility
accounts   using both the fact-checkers’  and Top 50’s lists. This  consistency is a      very
important indication that the results discussed in this section are robust and do not depend
on    the specific methodology employed   to  construct the   lists of low-credibility and
high-credibility accounts. Consequently, we merged the two lists into        one consolidated
dataset for the results presented below. For a comparison of the results derived from the
two lists, please refer to Appendix 5.2.3.

D. Note on handling of Political accounts
We treated accounts   of   politicians or political parties separately, categorizing  them as
‘Political’. These accounts were excluded from the primary analysis presented in the Results
below. For results including political accounts, see Appendix 5.2.5.


A. Accounts’ Followership
The first observation is that high-credibility accounts consistently have larger audiences
than low-credibility accounts. As shown in Figure 2.6, the average number of followers for
accounts in  the High-credibility lists  is  significantly higher than for those in the


Low-credibility lists across all platforms. Accounts classified as Neither  generally have
follower counts that are statistically similar to high-credibility accounts.

The confidence  intervals for the High-credibility and Neither lists        are relatively wide,
reflecting the  presence  of accounts that  have millions of followers      more than      other
accounts   in  the dataset.   These   include well-known  media organizations   in         the


B. Accounts’ Engagement Rates: The ‘Misinformation Premium’
While followership provides insight into audience size, the Code of Conduct encourages
platforms to increase the visibility of trustworthy content while reducing the amplification
of misleading content, particularly from sources that repeatedly share mis/disinformation[³].
To capture this, we compared the average number of interactions per post        per 1 000
followers across the different account groups. Normalizing by follower count allows us to
fairly compare accounts of different sizes: given a similar audience, an account would be
expected to receive comparable engagement for its posts.

       Table 2.3 – Average number of followers (in thousands) for accounts in the High-credibility,
Low-credibility, and Neither lists on each platform, as displayed in Figure 2.6. Values in square brackets
                                 correspond to 95% confidence intervals.

    Figure 2.7 shows that, across platforms, low-credibility accounts receive significantly higher
    interactions per post than high-credibility accounts. LinkedIn is the only exception, where
    differences     are not    statistically  significant.  The magnitude of engagement varies
    considerably     across    platforms:     low-credibility  accounts average approximately 5
    interactions       per post per 1 000 followers on Facebook, while on Instagram this figure is
    about ten times higher at about 46.

    Considering the ratio      of engagement for low-credibility versus high-credibility accounts,
    which can be seen as a “misinformation premium”, the differences are striking (see Figure
    2.8). On YouTube, low-credibility accounts receive more than 8 times the engagement of
    high-credibility    accounts. Facebook shows a similar pattern (7.2×), while Instagram and
    X/Twitter exhibit ratios of approximately 5×. The lowest ratios are observed on TikTok (2×)
    and LinkedIn, where low-credibility accounts do not outperform high-credibility accounts in
    interactions per post per follower.

    square brackets correspond to 95% confidence intervals.


Note that this     section compares platforms using the metric of interactions per post per
follower. Although view-based metrics were available for    some platforms, we did not
manage to obtain views on posts we collected from sources of high and low credibility
across  all six platforms. To ensure comparability, we therefore report   interaction-based
metrics here. For reference, results based on views per post per follower are presented in
Appendix    5.2.4. The total number of interactions were calculated by aggregating      the
number of comments, shares and likes of each post.

To ensure our findings are not an artefact of follower-count differences (i.e., low-credibility
accounts typically having fewer followers, which can be correlated with interactions per
post )  we  conducted a      robustness test restricting  the comparison       to high- and
low-credibility accounts with similar follower counts (see Appendix 5.2.6). The results are
generally unchanged when stratifying by account size: low-credibility accounts still exhibit
a significant interaction premium, confirming the robustness of the effect reported here.

C. Proportion of High/Low credibility accounts in the Top 50
Another   indicator of how relatively   influential repeat mis/disinformation  accounts are
compared to credible sources on a platform can be obtained by looking at the proportion
within the Top 50 of accounts that are low-credibility versus high-credibility.

Figure 2.9 shows that the platform with the highest proportion of low-credibility accounts
in the Top 50 is X/Twitter with about 34%, followed by TikTok with 29%. On Facebook and


YouTube, about 20% in the Top 50 are low-credibility accounts. The platform with the

2.3 CROSS-PLATFORM ASPECTS of MIS/DISINFORMATION
As demonstrated in the Prevalence and Sources sections, mis/disinformation and accounts
that consistently        publish such content can be found across all platforms. Research has
shown that  misleading narratives      often travel between platforms[¹⁴].  Although        a
comprehensive study of how specific    mis/disinformation narratives propagate         across
services is beyond the scope of this report, we aim to explore how welcoming different
platforms   are to sources of mis/disinformation. Specifically, this section investigates the
existence   of mis/disinformation sources across  platforms, as         recommended by EDMO’s
second report, which urges the investigation of "the existence of disinformation sources on
other platforms    based on users/accounts identified as sources     of disinformation in the
sample".

In alignment with this recommendation, we present indicators that assess the extent to
which low and high credibility actors operate across different platforms and the audience
sizes they manage to cultivate on each.

Starting with the consolidated dataset of high- and low-credibility accounts developed in
Section 2.2, which combines the Top 50 and fact-checker-identified accounts, we examined


whether these accounts maintained a presence on other very large online platforms. For
each account, we manually searched other platforms     using their       name and username.
Accounts were then labeled as ‘active’ if they had posted at least once in 2025 or ‘inactive’
if they had not posted during this period. Only active accounts were included in the study.

This process resulted in the creation of a cross-platform actors dataset, where an actor is
defined as a collection of accounts operated by the same source across different platforms.
In total, the dataset includes 341 high-credibility actors and 315 low-credibility actors,
which amounts to 656 unique actors that have an active account on at least one of the six
platforms analyzed.


A. Platforms Favored by Low and High credibility Actors
Figure 2.10 illustrates the proportion of actors with active accounts on each platform.
Among low-credibility actors in our dataset, Facebook is the most popular platform, with
50% maintaining an active   account, followed by X/Twitter   (43%) and YouTube (38%).
High-credibility actors in this dataset, on the other hand, favor Instagram (45% of active
accounts), followed by Facebook (41%) and YouTube (39%).

To understand how much more likely a low-credibility actor is to have an account on a given
platform compared to a high-credibility actor, we calculate the ratio of the percentage of
low-credibility actors with an account on the platform to the percentage of high-credibility
actors with an account.

Our analysis  shows    that X/Twitter is the most   comparatively attractive platform   for
low-credibility actors in this   dataset, with a 34% higher likelihood of having an account
than high-credibility actors (see Table 2.5). Similarly, Facebook (+23%) and TikTok (+17%)
appear to   be relatively more attractive to low-credibility actors. YouTube shows similar
proportions for both groups, with both low- and high-credibility actors maintaining active
accounts at approximately the same rate (38% versus 39%). In contrast, LinkedIn is the
platform where low-credibility actors are least likely to maintain an account, with an 80%
lower likelihood      compared to high-credibility actors, followed by Instagram (33% lower
likelihood).

Note that only a small portion of actors maintained a presence across all six platforms: 7
Low-credibility actors and 39 High-credibility actors. However, when excluding LinkedIn
(the platform with the fewest accounts among low-credibility actors), the number of actors
with accounts on the remaining five platforms increases to 28 for low-credibility actors and
55 for high-credibility actors. This suggests that credible sources have a greater ability to


    maintain a significant cross-platform presence.

    The last column displays the ratios of low- to high-credibility proportions.

    B. Ratio of Low-credibility to High-credibility Followership Size
    To further assess how welcoming each platform is       to accounts that repeatedly share
    mis/disinformation, we analyzed the number of followers these accounts manage to gather
    compared to high-credibility accounts on each platform.

    By this measure, YouTube emerges as the platform most favorable to low-credibility actors,
    with the ratio of their average number of followers to    that of high-credibility accounts


around 0.5 (see Figure 2.11). This indicates that low-credibility actors attract an audience
size that is approximately half that of high-credibility sources, which typically represent
professional teams dedicated to providing accurate information.

On Facebook,     low-credibility actors have a followership size about one-third that of
high-credibility actors, followed by    TikTok (about one-quarter) and X/Twitter (about
one-fifth). At the opposite end, LinkedIn and Instagram are platforms where low-credibility

In summary, these findings highlight the differential reception of low- and high-credibility
actors across platforms. Platforms like YouTube and Facebook appear particularly favorable
to low-credibility actors, both in terms of the number of accounts active on these platforms
and their relative audience size. In contrast, LinkedIn and Instagram tend     to be more
favorable to high-credibility actors, reflecting a more professional user base.

These results should be considered in conjunction with the findings in Section 2.2.2, which
showed that low-credibility sources  consistently generate higher engagement, both in
terms  of interactions and, where available,   views (see Appendix 5.2.4),     compared to
high-credibility accounts. Taken together, these findings suggest that while low-credibility
actors attract fewer   followers, often by a   significant margin, their content  achieves
disproportionately high levels of engagement once posted.


This discrepancy highlights a structural imbalance in how content from low-credibility
actors is surfaced and amplified by platforms, as well as how users engage with it. While
High-credibility actors maintain a stronger follower base, low-credibility actors are able to
leverage platform dynamics and user behavior to achieve visibility far beyond what their
follower count alone would predict.

2.4 MONETIZATION of MIS/DISINFORMATION
Commitment 1 of the Code of Conduct sets out five Measures that online platforms and
search engines should take to reduce the financial incentives for the production         and
dissemination of disinformation, at both the content and the account level. These Measures
include platforms adopting policies to avoid placing ads next to mis/disinformation content,
having systems in place to ensure that systematically-violative accounts cannot benefit
from monetisation programs, and providing more transparency and third-party scrutiny
over those Measures’ effectiveness.

While platform Signatories to the Code (with the exception of LinkedIn) have unsubscribed
from some of these Measures in early 2025, measuring the extent to which signatories are
funding the production of mis/disinformation remains as relevant as it was when the Code
was first negotiated. As such, a   robust Code monitoring framework should include         a
Structural Indicator on monetization.

A. DATA ACCESS
As pointed out in EDMO’s second report, a methodologically-sound Structural Indicator on
demonetization requires data that    is, so far, inaccessible to outside researchers using


publicly available data. Two critical data points are currently not available for any of the
platforms studied, specifically:

    ● the amount of revenue that a given account is generating from the platform, across
     monetization  methods      (e.g.,  ad-revenue  sharing,  tipping,  creator   marketing
     partnerships with brands, on-platform shops, etc),
    ● whether a given piece of content is contributing to the creator’s revenue stream from
     that platform.

Because they are directly tied to financial payouts, it is highly likely that these data points
are readily available. Future iterations of the Structural Indicators should request this data
from  the  platforms  under DSA Article 40.4,       as the system is    expected to become
operational by the end of 2025.

B. A PRELIMINARY LOOK AT ACCOUNT-LEVEL AD REVENUE SHARING
In  the absence    of such  relevant,   comparable-across-platforms  data, a     “best-effort”
approach was adopted to highlight the gap between the current publicly-available data
offering and the Structural Indicators’ ambitions. Our study focused on ad-revenue sharing
or other platform payouts related to content popularity, as all platforms of interest offered
such  programs. Other monetization      features, such as  brand partnerships (disclosed or
undisclosed), tipping or subscriptions  were      left out, but will be requested in future
iterations.

In most cases, platforms impose two types of criteria to benefit from ad-revenue payouts:
meeting some activity and audience thresholds (e.g. at least 5 videos posted in the last 90
days, garnering 100 000 views)         as well as being in good standing with regards to the
platform’s community guidelines.

To isolate to    the extent possible the latter factor, as this is where we would expect the
effect (if any) of disinformation-relevant policies to materialize, we adopted a comparative
approach, differentiating between high-credibility and low-credibility accounts. We started
from the lists of accounts used in the cross-platform Structural Indicator (section 2.3.1),
keeping    only accounts   that  had    posted    at   least  one piece of content  of     a
monetization-eligible format    during  the April-June 2025     period. We filtered out  the
accounts that did not meet the publicly-observable activity and audience criteria, leaving
only accounts potentially eligible for monetization (the full platform-specific methodology
is  available in   Appendix  5.3).  We  hypothesized        that, under properly functioning
demonetization systems, eligible high-credibility accounts would be monetized to a large
extent, while low-credibility ones would not be monetized.


TikTok, LinkedIn, X/Twitter and Instagram did not offer usable data and/or made it
impossible to reasonably infer (even indirectly) a given account’s monetization status and
were consequently left out (see Appendix 5.3 for a discussion). Google Display Ads was
included, as the service is covered by the Code (under Google Ads) and, unlike the other
Structural Indicators, it  could be audited using the same methodology as the other
platforms.

For  the services covered, each actor’s           likely monetization status was inferred, either by
checking if it   was present   in     the official      list of monetization partners (in the      case of
Facebook) or by seeing how frequently ads appeared on their content (YouTube, Google
Display Ads). Results were then aggregated for each credibility category (see Appendix 5.3
for full details).

Table 2.7 – Number and proportion              of high- and  low-credibility assets likely benefitting from
ad-revenue sharing with different services. Assets refer to Pages (Facebook), channels (YouTube), or
web domains (Google Display Ads).

Table 2.7 summarizes our results, showing how many channels or domains there are in our
dataset, how many of them are eligible for monetization and the proportion of eligible
accounts for which we have been able to confirm their monetized status. In absolute terms,
we observe that none of the services is fully successful in ensuring that low-credibility
accounts do not receive a share of ad revenue. However, the level to which this was the
case varied widely across platforms: while only a minority of low-credibility actors were
likely monetizing using Facebook and Google Display Ads (20% and 26.5%, respectively), a
vast  majority   of low-credibility   YouTube channels are, with more than three-quarter of
eligible accounts monetized (76.2%).

Comparing   monetization      levels      of      high-  and    low-credibility actors     confirms    this
observation: both groups are monetized at the same levels on YouTube (78.5% vs 76.2%),
while a gap exists between them on Facebook and Google Display Ads (60.3% vs 20% on
Facebook and 70.4% vs 26.5% on Google Display Ads).


3. Recommendations

FOR POLICYMAKERS AND REGULATORS

1) Make Structural Indicators part of routine super vision
Structural Indicators  should be embedded    in  the ordinary supervisory cycle          for
VLOPs/VLOSEs. Regulators should require platforms to assist independent third-parties so
they can audit a harmonised set of indicators on a regular schedule (e.g., twice a year).

2) Operationalise and enforce researcher access (DSA Art. 40.12)
Art. 40.12 access should move from ad-hoc, platform-specific negotiations to a predictable,
enforceable regime, in line with researcher access to non-public data under Article 40.4.
The Board and DSCs should publish a common EU data schema, a minimum technical
standard, and service-level agreements for response times.

Access decisions should be logged, reasoned, and appealable within fixed deadlines that
are   compatible with  research  timelines. We   fail  to see a compelling need          for
well-established, reputable organizations studying topics evidently linked to DSA systemic
risks to     have to routinely wait months before receiving access to publicly-available data.
Where    a platform    denies, unduly delays, or offers   degraded/obsolete         endpoints,
researchers should have a clear, time-effective pathway to escalate 40.12 complaints to
regulatory authorities.

3) Require random content samples
To estimate prevalence credibly, each platform should provide random samples of public
content per Member State large enough to reach agreed precision (e.g., ±2-3 percentage
points at  95% confidence). Each delivery should include  a signed manifest describing:
population covered,    inclusion/exclusion rules (e.g., account types, surfaces), sampling
method and seed, and any known coverage gaps.

4) Make samples auditable and reproducible
Regulators should require platforms to furnish reproducible sampling artefacts (e.g., seed
values, hashing logic for selection), stable identifiers for content and accounts, and minimal
metadata necessary to  verify  inclusion.  Independent  auditors designated by authorities
should be able to re-draw the same sample ex post and to verify that no classes of content
were silently excluded.


FOR PLATFORMS
To enable reproducible, cross-platform Structural Indicators while protecting users’ privacy,
platforms should implement two complementary access pathways.

1) Research APIs / bulk exports (ongoing access)
Platforms should maintain stable, well-documented endpoints  (or periodic bulk files)
exposing  public content and public account  data, partitioned by Member State and
language. The minimum fields required are:

 ● Content-level exposure & interactions:
  Unique content ID; creator account ID; post timestamp; language; surface of exposure
  (feed,  search,  recommendations,       ads  adjacency);  impressions;  interactions
  (reactions/likes, comments, reshares/reposts, saves/bookmarks).
 ● Account-level metadata:
  Account ID;    followers number; audience geography; participation in creator/partner
  programmes (eligibility, enrollment dates).

2) One-off “regulator y samples” (time-bounded audits)

Alongside ongoing APIs, platforms should deliver time-bounded datasets for specific audit
windows    (e.g.,  a defined month around an election).  These samples must           be
platform-generated and accompanied by a signed sampling manifest (inclusion/exclusion
criteria, randomisation method, seed…). They should include records for content later edited
or removed within the window to avoid survivorship bias. Where payouts or ad adjacency
apply, include     content-level monetisation eligibility  flags and account-level    payout
aggregates for the window.

Together,  the ongoing APIs      (for longitudinal research) and the regulatory samples (for
verifiable point-in-time audits) provide the  minimum infrastructure needed to compute
Structural Indicators that are comparable across platforms and reproducible over time.


4. Can Large Language Models help measure
Structural Indicators?

We piloted the use of large language models (LLMs) to assist with content filtering and
pre-labelling, with two goals: test where automation can safely reduce manual workload,
and quantify the reliability and cost of such automation. Human annotation remained the
source of truth for all indicators in this wave.

4.1 POST-LEVEL ASSISTANCE FOR THE PREVALENCE INDICATOR

Filtering out Irrelevant content
For the  Prevalence Indicator, we used GPT-4o-mini    to help filter posts retrieved via
keyword searches that fell outside the scope of our study (e.g., celebrity gossip, recipes,
personal anecdotes, or uses    of “COVID-19” purely as a time marker). The model also
flagged  Geographically Irrelevant items (e.g., Spanish  or French   content   about Latin
America or francophone Africa).

Because processing the full corpus (~3 million posts) would have been cost-prohibitive, we
applied this automated filtering to a random sample of up to 20 000 posts per platform
when available. Early performance was promising but imperfect; several prompt iterations
and spot-checks by fact-checkers   were needed to   curb both over-   and under-filtering.
Further prompt refinement is warranted.

During the process, we encountered several challenges.

First, applying LLMs to video-first platforms introduced additional constraints. For YouTube
and TikTok, effective text-based classification requires access to transcripts; acquiring them
is costly, transcripts are not always available, and many TikTok videos contain only music
with on-screen text, which is time-consuming and expensive to extract reliably.

Second, even on text-centric platforms, attached media (images/videos) can alter meaning
or  conceal misinformation. Because    of storage   and  processing  costs,  we did  not
systematically download and parse attached media, which may have reduced the LLM’s
ability to capture the full semantics of some posts.

Categorising content

After fact-checkers completed annotations on the view-weighted random sample (labeling
posts as Mis/disinformation, Credible, Borderline, Abusive, Unverifiable, Irrelevant), we


tested whether LLMs could replicate these labels. The goal was to assess whether LLMs
could accurately replicate the work done by fact-checkers and potentially scale this process
for larger datasets.

To  do so,  we used the dataset annotated by the fact-checkers as a testing ground to
evaluate  the performance of various            LLMs. We tested three models: Mistral Medium 3,
Magistral   Medium  1 and  GPT-4o-mini, primarily on  text-heavy platforms           (Facebook,
LinkedIn).

The categorization process involved several key steps:

   1. Relevancy  Rating:  The LLMs   first rated posts to determine     whether they  are
    Irrelevant. Posts deemed irrelevant were filtered out at this stage.
   2. Initial Labeling: The LLMs analyzed relevant posts, comparing it to factual information
    in its knowledge base.
   3. Enrichment (optional ): If  the LLM identified  gaps in context   or knowledge,  it
    conducted a web search to gather additional information and enrich its understanding
    of the post's content.
   4. Final Labeling: With the    enriched context, the LLM re-evaluated   the  post, now
    assigning it one of the labels.

After several tests, the results showed room for improvement. The accuracy of the LLMs to
properly identify posts containing mis/disinformation varied significantly by language, with
the Mistral models offering the highest accuracy, but still only achieving between 50% and
70% accuracy, depending on the language.

Crucially, enrichment via web search, often required for correct interpretation, significantly
increased cost. Given accuracy and cost, scaling this pipeline for core labelling was not
deemed sustainable for this wave; we retained it as an R&D track.

4.2 ACCOUNT-LEVEL ASSISTANCE FOR THE SOURCES INDICATOR
For the Sources Indicator, LLMs supported fact-checkers in assessing the credibility of
influential accounts (the whole process is described in Section 5.2.2). We collected posts
by candidate accounts during 17 March–13 April 2025, including associated media where
feasible. On YouTube and TikTok, we downloaded available video transcripts and fed the
first ~250 words into the model; we applied the same approach to short-form video (e.g.,
Instagram reels) when transcripts existed. When images were attached to posts, they were
included in the data examined by the model to capture additional cues.

Here, LLMs were helpful as triage tools: while they are of limited reliability for determining
whether a single post is definitively mis/disinformation, they usefully surfaced a shortlist of


posts from a given account that likely warranted closer human review. Fact-checkers then
made the final credibility determination more quickly.

5. Appendices

5.1 METHODOLOGY FOR THE PREVALENCE INDICATOR

5.1.1 Data collection
To collect data that reflects the diverse type of content users are exposed to on platforms,
we selected approximately 100 keywords per language. These words were chosen for their
relevance to the public  conversation within the European space and their connection to
topics that are often found in misleading claims or local issues in our target countries.
Additionally, given the various spellings and declensions of certain keywords depending on
the language,   we included plural forms   and grammatical variations to ensure broader
coverage and capture more relevant posts, as well as accounting for compound words,
using  an exact match    search when possible. We focused  on    five major topics:   the
Russo-Ukrainian conflict, climate change, general health (including Covid-19), migration,
and local politics. The full list of keywords is available to scientists upon request for any
legitimate research project.

The keyword lists were developed by the fact-checkers in our consortium, with the goal of
striking  a balance between topic-relevant terms    across a spectrum    of proximity  to
misleading claims. These include “neutral” keywords typically used in news reporting or
general discussions (e.g., Zelensky, migrants, Covid-19), “ambiguous” terms associated with
certain narratives (e.g., vaccine side effects, geoengineering, laboratories in Ukraine), and
“misinformation-related”  terms that are   more commonly linked to  misinformation     (e.g.,
Ukrainian Nazi, climate scam, remigration).

The lists of keywords were tested by fact-checkers to ensure they yielded relevant and
pertinent results. For each keyword in the local language, fact-checkers conducted searches
on at  least two platforms  from the six   VLOPs included in this study. The criteria for
determining whether a keyword should be included in the analysis were as follows:

    •     The results should contain viral posts, defined as those with more than 50k views
or over 1k interactions. These posts should be relatively recent (within the last six months)
and appear on both platforms.   If no viral and recent posts are found on at least one
platform, the keyword was excluded.
    •    More than 50% of the content in the search results should be directly related to
the topic   being searched (e.g., climate change, health, Ukraine war, or immigration) and
relevant (excluding entertainment or opinion posts). If most of the content was off-topic or
irrelevant, the keyword was excluded.


       •  For  keywords  in  the  ambiguous  or  misinformation-related  categories,
fact-checkers were instructed to exclude the keyword if no viral misinformation posts were
found within the first 20 results.

This process ensured that only keywords with a substantial presence of relevant and viral
content were included for the analysis.

The first data collection period spanned 17 March to 13 April, and we collected posts that
are published between these dates (inclusive). To collect data from the selected platforms,
we employed two different methods. First, given that this project investigates the systemic
risk of disinformation, as defined in the Digital Services Act (DSA), Article X, we invoked
Article            12 of the DSA and contacted all six VLOPs on 19 December 2024 to request a
random sample of 200 000 posts per language. Of the six platforms we contacted, only
LinkedIn  provided a random data sample. This dataset consisted of public posts          from
LinkedIn members and companies whose location is set to our countries of interest, with a
maximum of 200 000 posts per language. The exact number varied depending on data
availability in each respective country. TikTok granted us access to its researcher API on 31
March 2025; however, this access came too late in the data collection process to be used.
Following our initial outreach, we sent follow-up reminders to Meta and YouTube but did
not receive a response. As for X/Twitter, our application was denied on 9 January 2025,
with the platform stating that the project does not meet the requirements under Article 34
of the    Digital Services Act. We submitted an appeal on 17 January 2025, but as of
September 2025, we had not received a reply.

The second method involved identifying alternative tools that enabled access to          each
platform’s native search functionality and allowed us to perform keyword-based searches.
Since access to platform data varies depending on the technical restrictions imposed by
each platform, we adopted a tailored approach for data collection. Specific methods were
selected and implemented based on the technical and policy constraints of each platform. A
detailed         breakdown of the data collection approach used for each platform is provided
below.

A. META
Data collection for the META platforms (Facebook and Instagram) was carried out manually
on a biweekly basis using the Meta Content Library. Each week, data which was posted in
the timeframe Monday to Wednesday was collected on Thursday, and data for Thursday to
Sunday was collected the following Monday. This was made possible by using the date
filter available  in the platform's user interface, which allowed us to target     only those
specific days and retrieve all of the content that was made available to us on that specific
week.


For  Facebook, Meta offers the possibility to download a subset of the public           content
dataset, which includes posts from Pages with 15 000 or more likes or followers, and from
Profiles  with a verified badge and at least 25 000 followers. We conducted a manual
search using the boolean search function on the 100 keywords per language, targeting
Profiles, Pages, and Groups. To narrow the scope, we applied the Post Surface Country and
Language filters corresponding to each country of interest.

For Instagram, Meta also allows access to a subset of public content, including posts from
Business, Creator,  and Personal accounts  with at least   25 000 followers or       a verified
badge.   Just as for Facebook, we conducted a manual search using the boolean search
function on approximately 100 keywords per language, targeting Business, Creator, and
Personal  accounts,  and  applied the Language     filter  for  each respective        country.
Additionally, we used the  image-text search  feature to   identify relevant content       that
included keywords within images. The resulting dataset included various types of content,
such as posts, reels, and images, along with associated metadata. This metadata comprised
elements such as the content description, number of likes, comments, interactions, and
views for each post.

To ensure an accurate reflection of the content's reach and engagement, all posts were
collected within a   maximum of four days from their publication. This short         time frame
allowed us to    capture  content while it was still actively circulating. To account for the
potential increase in user engagement over time, we revisited the same posts at the end of
the data collection period to update their metadata, such as the interactions metrics and
view counts.

B. X/TWITTER
Data collection for X/Twitter was conducted daily using Apify, a licensed third-party tool,
searching for  the   language related keywords. Apify relies  on a scraper that leverages
X/Twitter’s native search functionality, specifically through the ‘searchTerms’ field, allowing
for keyword-based content retrieval. Similar to X/Twitter’s search interface, Apify enables
users to  select the type of  content to   display,  including Latest posts, Trending posts,
Photos, or Videos. For the purposes of this study, we selected the "Latest" filter to capture
the most recent posts published at the time of each search.

Apify also offers filters by date, which we used to retrieve content posted on the exact day
of collection, as well   as language  filters to target content specific   to the countries of
interest. It is important to note that X/Twitter does not provide a dedicated filter for the
Slovak language. As an alternative, we used the Czech language filter, based on guidance
from Demagog SK’s fact-checking team. This decision was informed by their confirmation
that  the Czech   language    filter returns content in Slovak  and   that Slovak audiences


frequently consume Czech-language content, given the linguistic similarities between the
two. To  ensure the relevance of the dataset for   the Slovak context, fact-checkers were
instructed to     label content that was not relevant to the Slovak population as Irrelevant,
following the guidelines outlined in Appendix 5.1.3.

To account for the potential increase in user engagement over time, we revisited the same
posts  at the end of the data collection period    to update their metadata, such as      the
interactions metrics and view counts.

C. YOUTUBE
Data collection for YouTube was conducted on a daily basis using Check First’s monitoring
system called CrossOver. This tool simulates user behaviour on the platform by replicating
native search functionality, returning results as they would appear to an actual user based
on their actual geographical location. Each day and for each language, search queries were
conducted, to capture a wide range of relevant content.

Due to platform search limitations and resource constraints, no date filters were applied
during the initial data collection phase. Instead,    we filtered content by publication date
during post-processing to ensure that only posts from 2025 were included in the analysis.
While content from other platforms was restricted to posts published between March 13
and April 17, we chose to include all YouTube videos posted at any point in 2025 (the same
applies to TikTok as detailed below). This decision reflects the longer content lifespan and
engagement cycle of YouTube videos compared to other platforms.

In addition to the primary search  results, the system also  captured the recommended
videos associated with each result.  This      approach allowed us to collect not only direct
search results, but also the broader content ecosystem that users are exposed to when
interacting with YouTube on our topics of interest.

D. TIKTOK
Data collection for TikTok was     conducted daily using Check First’s     monitoring system,
CrossOver. This    tool replicates TikTok’s native search functionality, simulating real user
behaviour and returning results         as they would appear to an actual user based on their
geographical location.

For each language, search queries were performed each day to capture a broad range of
relevant  content. Since   TikTok does not provide a native date filter, all videos retrieved
through keyword searches were later filtered during the post-processing phase, and only
content published in 2025 was included in the final dataset, matching our approach with
YouTube.


    To enhance data robustness and ensure broader coverage, we complemented this approach
    with a data collection using Bright Data, a third-party technology provider offering web
    data collection and proxy services. Bright Data was used to collect additional data based on
    the same predefined keyword searches. We merged           both datasets collected from
    CrossOver and Bright Data to constitute our final dataset.

    5.1.2 Data Processing & Sampling

    A. DATA CLEANING & PROCESSING

    The resulting dataset from the data collection period, spanning 17 March to 13 April,
    comprised a total of 2.6M posts across all platforms and target languages, after duplicates
    were removed. For TikTok and YouTube, only posts published in 2025 were retained, while
    for the remaining platforms,   we included exclusively the content published within the
    defined data collection period.

    Additionally, content not published in one of the targeted languages, i.e., Spanish, French,
    Slovak/Czech, English, or Polish was excluded.

    As shown in Table 5.1, TikTok leads in total views, accumulating approximately 8.3 billion,
    whereas X/Twitter records around 500 million, highlighting a substantial disparity between
    platforms. Across the full dataset of 2.6 million posts, spanning six platforms and four
    languages, the combined total reached 24 billion views, reflecting the overall reach of the
    content analyzed.

 Platform        Views                         Posts
       (entire dataset collected)    (entire dataset collected)
 Facebook    2 842 746 331                    221 011
Instagram    4 075 375 809                     77 629
 YouTube     2 165 804 082                     15 007
X/Twitter     470 224 104                    1 030 272
  TikTok     8 2313 62 104                     15 270
 LinkedIn    6 391 619 710                   1 227 569

    Table 5.1 – Total number of posts and views within the keyword search dataset

    Given the nature of the selected keywords and their potential use in varied contexts, some
    retrieved posts were unrelated to our topics of interest. For example, terms like “Covid-19”


were sometimes used as temporal markers rather than referring to the pandemic or the
disease itself, leading to the inclusion of irrelevant content.

To remove such content, we employed a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically a GPT
4o-mini, to filter out contextually irrelevant posts. Multiple versions of the classification
prompt were tested on a random sample of a total of 250 posts, with the results validated
by the   fact-checkers, until we identified  a prompt that     satisfactorily allowed us   to
discriminate relevant from irrelevant contents.

Due to the size of the dataset and the computational costs associated with LLM processing,
we selected a random sample of 20 000 posts per platform and per language on which to
apply the filtering. For text-based platforms (X/Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn), the
LLM was applied to the post descriptions. For video-based platforms (YouTube and TikTok),
we downloaded the video transcripts and used these as input for the filtering process.

The LLM classified content into three categories:

 ● Relevant: content contributing to public discourse on the state of the world, such as
     health, science, politics, climate change, or other societal issues with a direct impact on
     people’s lives or understanding of society
 ● Irrelevant: content on topics unrelated to our study or that do not match the definition
     of Relevant above; typically including celebrity gossip, sports, cooking recipes without
     health claims, beauty routines, and personal religious opinions.
●    Geographically Irrelevant Content:
            ○ posts that fall outside the geographical scope of the analysis such as posts in
         French discussing African politics, for instance,     or posts in Spanish addressing
         political developments in South America.
     ○ content     not  written in one   of    the targeted    languages: French,    Spanish,
         Slovak/Czech, Polish, or English

Content labeled as Irrelevant or Geographically Irrelevant were removed from the dataset.

B. RANDOM SAMPLING
To obtain a reliable proxy of the state of online discussions on high-sensitivity topics across
platforms, we drew a random sample of 500 posts per platform and language, weighted by
the number of views of each post.

Weighting by views was a critical step for three main reasons. First, it allows us to ensure
that widely viewed posts are more likely to appear in the sample, thus reflecting what
users are actually seeing on the platform. As shown in Table 5.2, the resulting weighted
sample accounts for a total of 3.8 billion views, with 1.9 billion views coming from TikTok


alone. Second, it helps mitigate potential biases introduced by platform-specific search
algorithms, which may be influenced by personalization or ranking mechanisms. Third, it
captures variations in topic salience, meaning that if, for example, posts about the war in
Ukraine receive significantly more engagement than those on climate change, they will be
proportionally more represented in our annotated sample.

                      Platform    Total number of views in the random
                                                 sample

5.1.3 Annotation

To ensure high-quality annotated data, each sample of 500 posts per platform and per
language   was individually       reviewed by fact-checkers   with relevant language and topic
expertise. These reviewers assessed whether the content contained misinformation, using a
classification framework developed         collaboratively  by the    fact-checking team.      The
framework was designed to reflect the wide variety of content typically encountered on
social media and to enable consistent application across platforms and linguistic contexts.

To ensure    the robustness       of our findings, assurance, a cross-verification process     was
implemented.   For each platform and language, a first fact-checker            was responsible for
annotating   the full sample      of 500   posts,  while a second  fact-checker      independently
reviewed a randomly selected 20% subset of the same sample. Both fact-checkers worked
blindly and    independently,     without  access  to each    other’s annotations,  ensuring    an
unbiased second layer of review.

In cases   where   discrepancies     arose between    the  two  reviewers,  a resolution     phase
followed the initial annotation. After the full dataset had been labeled, the fact-checkers
reviewed the cases with conflicting classifications, discussed their assessments, and agreed
on a final label for  each disputed item. This      process not only ensured consistency and
accuracy   in  content classification      but also enabled    us to  measure      inter-annotator
agreement, an important indicator of reliability, and to incorporate this information into the
calculation of confidence intervals for the final prevalence estimates, which is explained in
detail in Annex 5.1.4.


Fact-checkers were tasked to label each piece of content with one of the options below:

● Mis/disinformation:   Content   stating or clearly implying   a verifiably false      or
misleading claim that may cause public harm.
This definition is a simplified version of the one from the Code of Conduct.
● Credible and informative: Content       conveying  true or    credible information    on
important matters about the state of the world (excluding trivia, gossip, or anecdotes).
The Credible label was only applied to content that presents factual information on
topics with direct relevance to people’s lives or public understanding of society, such as
health,  science, politics, or social issues. These posts       had to be accurate     and
informative, i.e. contribute constructively to public discourse.
●        Borderline: Content feeding a misleading narrative without necessarily containing
outright falsehoods, but potentially reinforcing false beliefs.
This category captures content that does not meet the criteria for being labeled as
mis/disinformation but does nonetheless contribute to the spread or normalization of
misleading narratives. Research has   shown that    “factually  accurate  but    deceptive
content” about vaccines, for instance, can be “more consequential for driving vaccine
hesitancy than flagged misinformation” as it is more prevalent than strictly false or
misleading information[¹⁵]. This is the phenomenon we are intending to capture with
the Borderline category.
● Abusive: Content not containing mis/disinformation but involving harmful material
such as hate speech, insults, spam, or incitement to harmful behaviour.
Hateful or discriminatory content was only classified as mis/disinformation if it also
included false or misleading claims. Content that included hate speech or offensive
language alone, without a misinformation component, was labeled under the Abusive
category.
● Unverifiable:   Content      that   cannot  be assessed       as  either  credible   or
mis/disinformation (e.g. opinion-based).
For contents that address important societal topics but cannot be classified as either
credible or mis/disinformation, typically because they involve      personal or  political
opinions, or subjective commentary that fall outside the scope of factual verification,
we used the Unverifiable category.
● Irrelevant:     Content   not about public  affairs or scientific/political issues (e.g.
entertainment,    sports, religious  content, cooking recipes   without   health   claims,
geographically irrelevant to Europe).
Contents unrelated to     public-interest information or verifiable factual   claims  were
labeled Irrelevant. This includes song lyrics, sports updates, cooking recipes without
health   claims,  celebrity gossip,  expressions of   religious belief   without factual


   assertions, and purely personal anecdotes. Although we used an LLM to filter content
   outside the study’s geographical scope (Appendix 5.1.2) , this automated step was not
   foolproof; residual off-scope items could remain. To address this, fact-checkers were
   instructed to flag any posts as Irrelevant when centered on events in Latin America or
   Francophone Africa for instance, so as to maintain our focus on Europe.
      ●        Other language: Content is not in one of the languages spoken in the targeted
   country or English.
   Posts    written in languages other      than the targeted ones, French, Spanish, Slovak,
   Polish, or English, were labeled as Other Language.
      ●        Deleted: Content unavailable at the time of annotation (e.g. removed from the
   platform).
   Contents that had been deleted from platforms at the time of review were labeled as
   Deleted.
      ● Don’t know: Content not fitting any other category.
   Contents that could not be reliably classified under any of the defined categories due
   to ambiguity, lack of context, or incomplete information, were assigned the label Don’t
   Know. This ensured that all reviewed posts were accounted for, even when a definitive
   classification was not possible.

5.1.4 Inter-annotator Agreement and related Confidence Inter vals

Each content in the random sample was first annotated by one fact-checker, who assigned
it to one of the categories described above. A second fact-checker independently reviewed
a randomly selected 20% subset of the sample.

Figure 5.1 displays the number of cases when both fact-checkers agreed or disagreed on
the categorization of content across the five categories we study (Misinformation, Credible,
Borderline, Abusive,   and Unverifiable) across all platforms and languages. The rows
represent the classifications made by the second fact-checker, while the columns represent
the classifications by the first    fact-checker. The diagonal of the matrix shows the cases
where   both fact-checkers agreed  on    the   classification; we observe a high level    of
agreement between the fact-checkers given that the numbers on the diagonal are always
higher than the numbers outside of it on any given row or column. The sum of the numbers
on the  diagonal    shows that   the agreement rate is       87.5%. A source of disagreement
occurred between the categories Credible and Unverifiable, for instance; as we can see on
the confusion matrix, the first fact-checker rated content as Credible 36 times while the
second rated it as Unverifiable and the second fact-checker rated content as Credible 34
times while the first rated it as Unverifiable.


F igure 5.1 – Confusion Matrix Showing Inter-Annotator Agreement and Disagreement in Independent
Content Labeling

Once the data sample was fully labeled, the two fact-checkers   discussed cases where
discrepancies between the labels occurred and agreed on a “final label” for each piece of
content. When a final label was available for a given content, this label was used in the
prevalence calculation. However, when only the first fact-checker label was available, we
took into account the probability that the label proposed by the first fact-checker could be
wrong as described below.

To quantify the uncertainty around our estimates of prevalence, we applied a bootstrapping
technique  with 1 000 iterations. Bootstrapping is a resampling method that involves
repeatedly drawing samples with replacement from the original dataset and recalculating
the prevalence metric in each iteration. This process generates an empirical distribution of
the prevalence estimate, from which confidence intervals can be derived without relying on
parametric  assumptions. The bootstrapping thus allows us       to quantify the confidence
intervals around our estimate related to the size of our sample.

In addition to measuring the uncertainty related to sample size, we also accounted for
uncertainty arising from potential disagreements   between annotators.      Specifically, we
incorporated the frequencies with which the initial labels assigned by the first fact-checker
differed from the final label (when available), which we take as our best estimate of ground
truth.


To give a concrete example, in Slovakia the first fact-checker labeled 66 pieces of content
as Abusive. The final label agreed in 57 cases (86%), 4 were relabeled Unverifiable (6%), 4
Borderline     (6%), and 1 Mis/disinformation (1.5%). In the bootstrapping process, at each
iteration, we therefore randomly swapped the Abusive label             with Borderline with
probability 6%, with Unverifiable with probability 6%, with      Mis/disinformation    with
probability 1.5% and left it unchanged with probability 86% (percentages may not sum to
exactly 100% in this example due to rounding). Note that this         procedure was applied
separately for each country, to reflect potential team-specific biases.


A. PREVALENCE ACROSS CATEGORIES
As outlined in Section 2.1.2-A, the content breakdown across all six platforms reveals that
the combined categories of Credible and Unverifiable account for the majority of content on
all platforms. While the Unverifiable category provides valuable context for the type of
content commonly found on social media, as it typically encompasses personal opinions,
commentaries, and individual perspectives on global events       and news,  we sought  to
highlight the distribution of Credible versus Problematic contents in isolation. As defined in
Section 2.1.2-A, Problematic content refers to the combination of Abusive, Borderline, and
Mis/disinformation.

Figure  5.2 reproduces  Figure 2.2 excluding the Unverifiable    category.  This allows to
highlight  that LinkedIn has the lowest proportion of problematic      content, followed by
Instagram and then YouTube and Facebook. The highest levels of Problematic content as
compared to Credible content is found on TikTok and X/Twitter, where it represents a bit
less than half (47%) and a bit more than half (53%) respectively.

B. PREVALENCE OF MIS/DISINFORMATION + BORDERLINE
As we have explained above, content that is factually accurate   can still  lead users  to
misleading conclusions,     which we captured in the Borderline category. If one wants  to
measure the proportion of all potentially misleading content, one needs to   assess the
prevalence of Mis/disinformation and Borderline content together.

Figure 5.3  displays a measure of the proportion of posts labeled as  Misinformation or
Borderline, relative to the total number of posts labeled as Misinformation, Borderline,
Credible, or Unverifiable. In line with the patterns  observed   in the    prevalence   of
Mis/disinformation content, TikTok has the highest combined prevalence of Misinformation
and Borderline content, with 32% of posts falling into these categories. It is followed by


Facebook at 25% and X/Twitter at 24%. LinkedIn displays the lowest prevalence of such
content at 7%, indicating a significantly more limited presence of misleading content on this
platform.

C. MISINFORMATION PREVALENCE BY COUNTRY
Figure 5.4 illustrates the prevalence of misinformation across the four countries in         our
study. Results differ by country: in Poland and Spain, prevalence is not statistically different
across platforms (approximately 10% and 5%, respectively)      on all platforms   except
LinkedIn. By contrast, in France TikTok shows the highest prevalence (~40%), followed by
X/Twitter and Facebook (~20%). In Slovakia, TikTok and Facebook exhibit the              highest
prevalence (~18%), followed by YouTube (~10%).

5.2 METHODOLOGY FOR THE SOURCES INDICATOR

5.2.1 Data collection
The process of building a dataset of accounts that repeatedly share mis/disinformation
involved several stages and drew on multiple  sources, which allowed us to test    the
sensitivity of our results to the chosen methodology.


A. THE FACT-CHECKERS' LIST APPROACH
In  one  approach, fact-checkers from   the consortium compiled preliminary lists  of
trustworthy sources and social media channels known for sharing mis/disinformation for
each country. These lists were developed based on the fact-checkers' expertise, internal
databases   of accounts whose posts     have been fact-checked, and Science Feedback’s
Consensus Credibility Scores, which aggregate multiple open-source credibility ratings for
over  20 000 sources, providing a reliable   basis for identifying recurrent misinformation
sources[¹³].

B. THE TOP 50 LIST APPROACH
In another  approach, we leveraged      the keyword-based dataset  used in   Indicator 2.1
(Prevalence) to identify the most influential accounts in our dataset. For each platform and
language, we selected the top 200 accounts based on the cumulative number of views their
posts received  during  the data collection  period (17 March to   13 April  2025).     These
accounts   were manually reviewed by fact-checkers to   determine their relevance   to    the
study. Accounts were considered relevant if they regularly discussed topics of interest for
our  study,  disseminated   news,    or shared content  related    to  public affairs     and
misinformation. Conversely,    accounts focused exclusively on entertainment, sports,      or
celebrity news were excluded. From the pool of relevant accounts, we retained the top 50
per platform-language pair.

For  both  of the lists from above, the top  50 and fact    checkers       recommendation, we
collected all of their posts during the data collection window using third-party tools such
as BrightData and Apify, capturing not only post content but also associated metadata
(engagement    metrics, number   of followers,  images, and    videos). Due   to platform
limitations, view counts per post were only available for YouTube, TikTok, and X/Twitter. For
LinkedIn, where fewer accounts were active during the target period, we extended the data
collection  window by three weeks before and after      the data   collection period i.e., 24
February to 4 May.

It should be noted that, during dataset construction, we were unable to retrieve every post
from every account, leading to missing entries in both the Top 50 and the fact-checkers’
recommended     lists. These gaps stem from platform    and tool   constraints, as   well  as
accounts    that did   not post during  the  collection period   or  had deleted     content.
Consequently, we cannot guarantee that the retrieved posts represent the complete set of
posts published   by    these accounts  during the  period. While   this is  not  necessarily
problematic for metrics such as interactions per post, it prevents us from drawing definitive
conclusions about the total interactions or views generated by all posts from the accounts


in our dataset.

5.2.2 Annotation of Sources

Fact  checkers labeled the accounts in the Top 50 list into three different categories,
following these guidelines:
     •  Low-credibility:   Accounts that shared at   least two posts containing false      or
misleading information.
     •  High-credibility:  Accounts that   almost    exclusively  shared credible         and
informative news, such as content from professional media outlets or scientific institutions.
     •  Neither: Accounts that did not fit into the two categories above, often sharing
opinion-based.

High-credibility sources typically include reputable news organisations and digital-native
publishers known   for producing accurate  and  informative content. These  actors        are
characterised by adherence to organisational editorial standards and by operating under
legal   and regulatory frameworks that hold them accountable   for the reliability of     the
information they disseminate.

To assist the fact-checkers in this task, we used a Large Language Model (GPT 4o-mini) to
give a first estimation of whether each post shared by one of the top 50 accounts was likely
to contain mis/disinformation.

We developed a prompt that asked the LLM to rate each post for its likelihood of containing
mis/disinformation on a scale ranging from 0 to 10. Based on our testing conducted on a
sample of labeled posts, we noted that posts scoring:

     •  between    0   and 3, typically corresponded to    posts  labeled as Credible by
fact-checkers,
     •  between 7 and 10, typically corresponded to posts labeled as Mis/disinformation
by fact-checkers,
     •  between 4 and 6, tended to correspond to posts labeled as neither Credible nor
Mis/disinformation.

We thus used these thresholds to label each post as either Credible, Misinformation or
Neither. To enhance the reliability of the LLM’s classification, we validated the prompt on a
random sample of posts annotated by a fact-checkers, calculating the agreement rate to
assess model performance. We initially used GPT 4o-mini to label all posts, taking into
account not only the textual description but also any associated media, such as images and
videos. For posts that received a score equal to or above 7, indicating a higher likelihood of


misinformation, a second round of evaluation was performed using GPT 4o-mini with
web-browsing capabilities. This additional step was crucial for weeding out false positives,
typically associated with recent claims being wrongly labeled as misinformation by the
LLM’s out-of-date information. Posts initially labeled as misinformation with GPT 4o-mini
were re-evaluated using the same prompt in GPT with browsing capabilities. If the post’s
score dropped below 7 during this second round, its classification was revised accordingly.

Once each post had been individually labeled as either Misinformation, Credible or Neither,
we proceeded to aggregate these labels at the account level. This step allowed us to
propose a first, LLM-based, categorisation of accounts based on the overall nature of the
content they shared. An account was classified as:

 ● Low-credibility according to the LLM if it had two or more posts with scores above 7.
 ● High-credibility according to the LLM if at least 95% of its posts had scores below 3.
 ● Neither according to the LLM if none of the above conditions were met.

These suggestions by the LLM were then made available to fact-checkers who provided the
final classification. These pre-classifications by the LLM helped save time for fact-checkers,
as it allowed them to quickly identify the posts from each account that were more likely to
contain mis/disinformation.

For readers interested in the accuracy of the LLM, Figure 5.5 presents a confusion matrix
comparing its   account-level pre-classifications to the final classifications made by the
fact-checkers. The matrix  shows that   the LLM correctly identified 213 low-credibility
accounts but misclassified 64 of them, for instance. Overall, GPT reached a precision of
about 66% and recall of 75% for high-credibility accounts, and a precision of 62% and
recall of 77% for low-credibility accounts.

5.2.3 Sensitivity of results to the two lists

To ensure our indicators on Sources weren’t biased by the methodology used to constitute
the lists of high-credibility and low-credibility accounts, we tested the sensitivity of the
results by comparing the results obtained with the fact-checkers' list approach and with the
Top 50 list approach. The main metric we proposed as an indicator of whether platforms
welcome repeat sources of mis/disinformation is the number of interactions per post per
follower  that low-credibility accounts get  as compared to the same metric for
high-credibility accounts.


    F igure 5.5 – Confusion Matrix Showing Agreement and Disagreement between GPT
pre-classifications and fact-checkers final classifications of accounts in the Top 50 as High-credibility,
                                       Low-credibility or Neither.

    Figure 5.6 shows that, regardless of the specific approach used to construct the lists of
    low-credibility  and high-credibility  accounts,  the results  are  broadly    consistent.
    Low-credibility  accounts systematically outperform high-credibility accounts in terms  of
    interactions per post per 1 000 followers, and they do so by similar multiplying factors in
    both datasets. Based on these results, we decided to merge the high- and low-credibility
    lists originating from the fact-checkers and Top 50 approaches.    Note that for LinkedIn,
    fact-checkers    weren’t able to identify lists of high- or low-credibility based on their
    fact-checking activities, so only the dataset of the top 50 most influential accounts was
    used.




    5.2.4 View-based ‘Misinformation Premium’

    In Section 2.2.2-B, we show that posts from low-credibility accounts consistently receive
    higher engagement than posts     from high-credibility accounts on all platforms         except
    LinkedIn. Here we test whether this observation still holds when considering the number of
    views, instead of the number of interactions. Due to the platforms' inherent features and
    capabilities of the third-party tools we used, we were able to collect the number of views
    for all the posts published by accounts in our lists of high- and low-credibility accounts only
    on TikTok, YouTube and X/Twitter.

    Figure 5.7 shows that low-credibility accounts receive            more views per post per 1 000
    followers  than high-credibility accounts. On YouTube, low-credibility accounts         receive
    about three times as many views per post per 1 000 followers as high-credibility ones,
    while on TikTok and X/Twitter low-credibility accounts receive about twice as many views
    as high-credibility accounts.

    This result is consistent with the interactions-based metric discussed in section 2.2.2-B,
    although the magnitude of the difference between high- and low-credibility accounts is
    greater when comparing the numbers of interactions: the interactions-based misinformation

High-credibility (green), Low-credibility (red), and Neither (grey) on the three platforms where the
 number of views were available. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals, calculated using a


5.2.5 Results for ‘Political’ Accounts

Section 2.2.2 presented results that excluded accounts labeled as ‘political’ (accounts of
politicians or political parties). Given that the speech of politicians is     usually treated
differently in public discourse, notably by journalists, we did not want our results to be
potentially driven by the level of engagement they receive, which we expected could be
higher   than that of other accounts. However, in the labeling phase, posts from political
accounts were treated in the same way as posts from other accounts, so we were able to
label political accounts as either low-credibility if they shared two or more posts containing
mis/disinformation, or   Neither   if  they didn’t. No political accounts were labeled       as
high-credibility given the typically partisan nature of the content they share.

Figure 5.8 illustrates the mean number of interactions per post per 1 000 followers, similar
to Figure 2.6 but also including the two categories of political accounts. The figure shows
that, across most platforms, low-credibility accounts that are also political receive more
interactions per post    per 1 000     followers than both high-credibility and low-credibility
accounts.   The exceptions   are   LinkedIn, where  low-credibility political accounts  receive
significantly less interactions than other accounts, and TikTok, where our sample contains
few posts from low-credibility political accounts making the confidence interval overlap the
values of low-credibility non-political accounts.

5.2.6 Robustness test of the ‘Misinformation Premium’

Our   findings for the   Sources   Indicator show that low-credibility accounts outperform
high-credibility accounts in interactions per post and views per 1 000 followers. To ensure
this result is not driven by the typically smaller follower counts of low-credibility accounts,
we replicated the analysis by stratifying on account followership.

For each platform, we divided low-credibility accounts into four groups (quartiles) based on
follower count. Using the same follower-count ranges, we then grouped high-credibility
accounts into four corresponding groups. For example, on Instagram the quartiles were: Q1:
0-33 000       followers;    Q2:   33 000-70 000;      Q3:  70 000-140 000;     and    Q4:
140 000-3 500 000, applied to both low- and high-credibility accounts; any high-credibility
accounts above 3.5 million followers were excluded from the comparison. LinkedIn was the
exception: follower counts lacked sufficient dispersion, so only two groups were created.

                High-credibility, Low-credibility, Neither, Low-credibility Political and Neither Political lists on each
    platform, as displayed in Figure 5.8. Values in square brackets correspond to 95% confidence intervals.


This approach allowed us to compare high- and low-credibility accounts at similar audience
sizes, minimizing bias that could arise when comparing all accounts jointly, given their
different follower-count distributions. Within each      quartile, we calculated the mean
interactions per post per 1 000 followers, as in Section 2.2.2.B.

Table 5.4 presents the results, confirming those in Figure 2.7: across nearly all platforms
and quartiles, the mean interactions per post per 1 000 followers is significantly higher for
low-credibility accounts than for high-credibility accounts.

There are two exceptions:
(i)   LinkedIn, where high-credibility accounts do not differ statistically from low-credibility
accounts in interactions, consistent with Figure 2.7; and
(ii)  TikTok, where high-credibility accounts surpass    low-credibility accounts in the     4th
quartile; both are statistically tied in the 1st and 2nd quartiles; and low-credibility accounts
exceed high-credibility accounts only   in the 3rd quartile (120 000-730 000         followers).
These contrasts explain why, overall, the misinformation premium on TikTok is “only” ~2×.

5.3 METHODOLOGY FOR THE MONETIZATION INDICATOR

5.3.1 Facebook

As part of its advertiser brand safety offerings, Facebook publishes “partner-publisher
lists”, which “show publishers that have signed up for monetization and follow our Partner
Monetization Policies”. Those lists refer specifically to accounts whose video content can be
used for monetization (ads playing during videos or Reels).

As they do not capture    all types of ads (e.g.  ads on users’   feeds), nor all types of
monetization (subscription, Meta Stars, Facebook Content Monetization program, branded
content ), these lists are not exhaustive and can only be considered indicative of the broader
phenomenon of the monetization of disinformation on Facebook.

Starting with the Facebook accounts collected in Section 2.3 for which a fact-checker had
assigned a credibility label, the following criteria were applied:

● Only Pages were kept, filtering   out personal  profiles as     most are not eligible for
   monetization,


    ● Because of the partner-publisher lists’ focus on videos, Pages that had not recently
    published videos or Reels, or that had reached minimal audiences on such content,
    were marked as ineligible¹

    Table 5 5 shows the results for Facebook, same as Table 2 7 but stratified by country

    In July 2025, Facebook was in the process of rolling out its Facebook Content Monetization
    Program, which aims to combine many of the platform’s monetization features Starting in
    September 2025, this should result in the end of the specific in-stream Ads and ads on
    Reels programs, which formed the basis of the partner-publisher lists

    Given the absence of publicly-available data on accounts already     onboarded onto the
    Facebook Content Monetization Programme, it is doubtful whether the transition will result

    1 Specifically, a Page must have had a minimum of 5 videos or Reels published in the last 30 days AND at least 60 000 minutes watched on videos from the last
    60 days (calculated as number of views times video duration, divided by 2 to account for mid-play drops) As Facebook does not publish official activity and
    audience criteria anymore, these thresholds were derived from earlier guidance and might have changed since


 in sufficient data to conduct further analysis.

                            partner-publisher lists, indicating likely monetization.

 5.3.2 Instagram

 Instagram does not offer meaningful data to track account-level monetization. Transparency
 has taken a step back as Instagram stopped publishing its “partner-publisher lists” that
 detailed the accounts that were eligible for monetization in H1 2025.

 5.3.3 X/Twitter

 X/Twitter        does not offer    publicly-available       data as to the accounts its flagship revenue
 sharing mechanism (the “Creator Revenue Program”) supports. Consequently, we were not
 able to study monetization on X/Twitter. Future iterations will have to                  rely on access to
 platform data under DSA Article 40.4.

 5.3.4 LinkedIn

 In         2024,  LinkedIn launched       its  first  revenue-sharing  program     (Wire,  rebranded as
 BrandLink in May 2025). No consolidated data is publicly available as to which creators are
 taking part in the pilot program, although the few names cited in communications material
 belong to broadly credible actors, such as Der Spiegel or the Washington Post, alongside
 individual influencers. Consequently, we were not able to study monetization on LinkedIn.
 Future iterations will have to rely on access to platform data under DSA Article 40.4.

 5.3.5 TikTok

 TikTok offers two flagship programs to reward creators for the views their content garners:


 ● The TikTok Creator Rewards Programme, which, broadly, pays out users on the basis
  of     how well  their videos perform. The list of accounts  eligible to partake in       the
  program is not public.
 ● TikTok Pulse, which shares with creators the revenue from ads appearing next to the
  most trending videos (videos with a “Pulse Score” in the top 4 percent of all videos on
  TikTokthe Pulse Score being an internal metric blending “user engagement, video
  views and recent growth”). With no data on which videos are in Pulse Score top 4%
  nor on which accounts are eligible, a systematic study of the TikTok Pulse funding was
  not possible.
Consequently, we were not able to study monetization on TikTok. Future iterations will
have to rely on access to platform data under DSA Article 40.4.

5.3.6 YouTube

Similar to Facebook, we screened YouTube channels of high- and low-credibility actors (see
section 2.3) to see which were eligible for monetization on the basis of publicly-observable
criteria (i.e., criteria not related to the channel’s or content’s standing vis-a-vis YouTube’s
community guidelines).

These criteria are:

 ● Whether the channel has more than 1 000 subscribers,
 ● Whether the channel has      more than 4 000 hours of watch time over the last 12
  months on its videos (excluding Shorts). As this is not directly observable, we made
  the same assumption as for Facebook (sum of number of views on videos posted in the
  last 12 months multiplied by the video length, divided by 2 to account for view drops).

We then   aimed    to    check the effective monetization status of each.  However,   the
monetization status of the channel is not available from official databases. The last ten
videos published by a channel were collected and we observed how many of these videos
had ads (either before or during the video playing, or in the top-right-hand corner of the
video). Any channel with three or more videos displaying ads in the last ten was considered
monetized.

5.3.7 Google Display Ads

While the Google Display Ads network operates a very different service from that of social
media    platforms, the  monetization of websites repeatedly   serving       mis/disinformation
content  plays  an important   role in the for-profit disinformation ecosystem. In addition,
Google as a whole is a signatory to the Code, reporting for some Commitments as Google
Ads, which includes its Display Ads Network. Accordingly, we decided to include it in our


    analysis. Google Display Ads do not set a traffic threshold for web domains to be eligible to
    have ads served by Google displayed on their website. No eligibility filtering step was
    therefore necessary.

    Table 5.6 – Number and proportion of high- and low-credibility YouTube channels frequently
                  displaying ads, indicating likely monetization.

    Web domains were selected on the basis of the list of high- and low-credibility actors
    detailed in section 2.3. For each social media account, a manual search was performed to
    establish whether the entity or individual operating the account also had an official web
    domain. The social media account’s credibility rating was extended to the web domain,
    under the assumption that their editorial standards were equivalent.

    For each domain, up to five pages (randomly accessed from the homepage) were visited by
    the analyst. If the analyst saw ads served by one of Google’s main ad-serving services
    (doubleclick.net or googlesyndication.com), the website was marked as being monetized by
    Google. If no such ads were found on the 5 pages, the website was marked as not being
    monetized by Google.
