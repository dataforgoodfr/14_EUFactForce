While for Boorse value-freedom was an essential guard against politicization of medicine in general and psychiatry in particular, his solution of distinguishing between disease (value-free) and illness (value-laden) only delays the necessity of making value judgments to another stage, without eliminating this necessity. Today's demands on the concept of mental health are very much actionguiding.  Scientists  who  deploy  definitions  of  mental  health  deploy  them for  the  most  part  not  as  Boorsean  'theoretical  concepts' relevant only to dispassionate and pure scientific research. Instead, their goal is deeply practical-how and what to diagnose, how and what to manage, how and what to prevent. For these purposes, Boorse's definition of mental health does not provide the required normative guidance. This is unsurprising, given that Boorse does not think such guidance should be expected from the concept of health, so from his point of view this is not a weakness.
