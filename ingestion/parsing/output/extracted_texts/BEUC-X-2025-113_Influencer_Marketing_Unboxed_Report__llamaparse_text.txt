    THIS REPORT IN A NUTSHELL

Influencer marketing is everywhere and unavoidable
for anyone on social media due to the high volume
of content and boundless creativity of social media
influencers. Between March and September 2025,
14 BEUC consumer organisations from 12 countries
monitored about 650 posts and videos of social
media influencers on TikTok, Instagram, YouTube and
Snapchat.
Although influencer marketing is present in nearly all
sectors, this evidence-gathering focused on posts
and videos promoting unhealthy food advertising and
fast fashion as they are sectors where consumers are
likely to be particularly at risks. Evidence confirms the
widespread use of hidden advertising practices and how
influencers appeal to emotions to shape consumers’
preferences. It also shows how brands use influencer
marketing to give a positive spin to their reputation in
the eyes of consumers, in particular the youngest ones.
As we identified in 2023, current EU law is only partially
able to tackle the problems posed by influencer
marketing and needs to be updated.¹ It must clarify the
responsibilities of the different actors operating in the
influencer marketing environmentfrom influencers
and their agencies to brands and online platforms.
This report provides additional evidence supporting
ongoing policy discussions at EU and national level.
This is particularly the case for the EU Digital Fairness
Act and the evaluation of the Audiovisual Services
Media Directive, both expected in 2026.


    KEY FINDINGS

    Influencer marketing is today one of the most      common online advertising techniques . It refers to practices
    where brands cooperate with content creators against direct or indirect benefits for the purpose of advertising
    their products or services. It has  significant impact on consumer behaviour  and their online shopping experience, considerably boosting brands engagement, reach and sales. The evidence-gathering found that:

    Influencer marketing keeps taking place and spreading in
    opaque environments . Collected evidence in the food
    and fast fashion sectors confirms   widespread hidden
    advertising practices . Commercial messaging is often
    framed as expressions of personal style rather than
    advertisements, blurring the line between marketing
    and genuine personal views. Users have difficulties to
    differentiate them. Ads are often not labelled as such     2345
    and when they are, the terminology is often unclear and
    misleading. Discount codes and promotional links are       245
    often buried in the comment section under the posts.           4343

Additional contentious practices have emerged over the                 400 000
years, such as influencers  toying with emotions, relying on
gamification techniques, contests and other challenges. Such
practices hook consumers, encouraging   over-consumption

SUMMER       Some traders and brands – especially in
SHEIN am     the fast fashion sector – appear to also rely
             on influencer marketing to   boost their
             reputation and to make it more
             socially acceptable in the eyes of
             consumers.

The regulatory framework applying to influencer marketing
is complex and fragmented . Several pieces of EU legislation
come into play.² At national level, some Member States have adopted complementary rules. This means that multiple sectoral
authorities may be competent (consumer protection authorities,
audiovisual regulators, etc.) and have come up with their own
ways to address influencer marketing challenges.

RECOMMENDATIONS

From a regulatory perspective
Several updates are necessary to rein in influencer marketing. They should be considered in the context of the upcoming EU Digital Fairness Act (DFA) expected in 2026. This includes:

    ABOUT THE METHODOLOGY

    BEUC and its members conducted two separate evidence-gathering exercises throughout 2025.
     □  Fast fashion sector: 12 BEUC member organisations from 10 countries (Arbeiterkammer in Austria, Forbrugerrådet Tænk in Denmark, KEPKA and EKPIZO in Greece, Altroconsumo in Italy, Forbrukerrådet in Norway,
        Federacja Konsumentow in Poland, DECO in Portugal, Zveza Potrosnikov Slovenije in Slovenia, Asufin and
        OCU in Spain, and Fédération Romande des Consommateurs in Switzerland) collected over 350 examples of
        how influencers promote fast fashion companies on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and Snapchat between June
        and September 2025. The evidence was collected both from the platforms’ apps and web applications.

     □  Food sector : 5 BEUC member organisations  (Асоциация Активни потребители in Bulgaria, DECO in
        Portugal, OCU in Spain, Sveriges Konsumenter in Sweden and F édération Romande des Consommateurs in
        Switzerland) collected over 300 examples of how influencers promote unhealthy food (especially towards
        children) on Instagram between March and April 2025. BEUC selected 13 examples of influencer marketing
        promoting unhealthy foods to children relying on different marketing techniques and submitted them to the
        complaint mechanism of the self-regulatory EU Pledge, none of which were successful.³
    This evidence-gathering should be considered as a snapshot of current practices from across Europe and not as a
    scientific assessment. Screenshots are in the Annex accompanying this report.

    3     Launched in 2007, the EU Pledge (https://eu-pledge.eu/) is a self-regulation initiative of leading food companies in the EU to restrict unhealthy food
          marketing to children. Since 2008 the initiative allows the public to report potential non-compliance.



    THE BOOM OF INFLUENCER MARKETING AND ITS
    IMPACT ON CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR

Influencers are social media content creators with
above-average reach on digital platforms. 4 They can
be categorised by the size of their ‘followership’:
 •  ‘mega-influencers’ (+1 M followers)
 •  ‘macro-influencers’ (100,000 to 1M followers)
 •  ‘micro-influencers’ (10,000 to 100,000 followers)
 •  ‘nano-influencers’ (less than 10,000 followers).
According to a 2022 study, 5 the key elements defining
influencers are:
 •  Content creation, namely the service provided by
    influencers to other users.

 •  Commercial intent  , which is driven by
    direct revenue from brands (monetary and
    non-monetary), by revenues from audience
    engagement or by platform compensation.
 •  Monetisation, namely the generation of revenue
    through different business models, including but
    not limited to influencer marketing.
 •  Trust and authenticity,
                       namely the influence born
    to the parasocial relationship of trust established
    with the audience and the perceived authenticity
    and relatability of the content.
Traders and brands have long seen the added value of
cooperating with influencers to diffuse their products,
reach out to new audiences and ultimately trigger
consumption. A survey conducted in 2019 in France,
Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia and the United
States investigated the impact of influencer marketing
on consumer decision-making. It revealed that 41% of
users frequently discovered new brands and products
through influencers, and 87% were inspired to make a
purchase based on what they saw from an influencer.⁶

 A 2023 BEUC survey on fairness of the online
 environment found that 73% of consumers had
 seen promotional contents by influencers. More
 than half said they had bought products or
 services recommended by influencers.⁷
These patterns have fuelled an exponential rise in
influencer marketing expenses. Globally, between
2015 and 2025 the value of influencer marketing has
grown from USD 1.7 billion (approx. EUR 1.5 billion) to
more than USD 32 billion (approx. EUR 28 billion).  8 In
recent years, the sector has also become increasingly
professionalised. Agencies and content managers
coordinate campaigns across platforms using diverse
monetisation models, such as payments, affiliate
links, or in-kind rewards. 9 This reflects a broader shift
in advertising: influencers marketing now operate
through social interactions, and personal contents.
Anyone with a digital presence can promote products.
These developments raise new questions about the
fairness, accountability of influencers, and more
generally the regulation of online persuasion.
As opposed to traditional media where the audience is
passively engaging with contents, influencer marketing
is based on engagement with the audience. This is
part of an advertising experience where “parasocial
relationships”¹⁰ develop,  i.e. one-sided connections
with an online personality users have never met.
Influencer promotions blur the line between individual
expression and commercial messaging. Consumers
are more likely to perceive these advertisements
as genuine recommendations, especially when the
commercial intent is unclear.

 88% of users aged 15 to 24 report being inspired
 or convinced by influencer content.¹¹

    WHAT RULES GOVERN INFLUENCER MARKETING

An EU regulatory piecemeal
Influencer marketing stands at the crossroad of
several pieces of EU legislation. They apply in parallel
to different categories of actors involved. This raises
questions about the coordination, possible overlaps
and gaps when these rules are interpreted and
enforced.
The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive
The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (UCPD,
EU Directive 2005/29/EC) applies to business-toconsumer commercial practices. Although the
UCPD does not provide for a clear legal definition of
influencer marketing, its Guidance document indicates
influencers may qualify as ‘traders’ or can be seen as
acting ‘on behalf of traders’ when they engage in
endorsement activities on a frequent basis regardless
of the size of their audience. The UCPD imposes on
influencers to properly disclose the commercial intent
of their posts. It specifically prohibits practices which
do not make it clear that a trader has paid for the
promotion of a product in editorial content. The UCPD
prohibits aggressive commercial practices, which may
apply when influencers target vulnerable consumers
such as children or teenagers. It also prohibits direct
exhortations towards children in all circumstances. In
parallel, the UCPD also applies to online platforms when
they contribute to disseminating misleading influencer
posts. Social media platforms must exercise a certain
level of care and diligence to ensure that their users are
not harmed by other users, including influencers.¹²

The Digital Services Act
The Digital Services Act (DSA, EU Regulation 2022/2065)
aims to promote a safer online environment and
therefore clarify online platforms’ roles and duties
regarding advertisements. The DSA requires online
platforms to provide an option for users to declare
that the content they post is commercial.  13 Online
platforms are not allowed to target or personalise
advertising to minors based on their personal data.   14
In parallel, the European Commission should promote
the development and implementation of voluntary
standards that make transparency both effective and
consistent across all EU online platforms. 15 Finally, the
DSA requires online platforms to identify, analyse and
assess any systemic risks, which arguably could come
from influencer marketing content. Online platforms
should address and mitigate any influencer misleading
or harmful practice that might be a systemic risk upon
identification.¹⁶
The Audiovisual Media Services Directive
The Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD, EU
Directive 2010/13/EU) covers all types of audiovisual
contents, irrespective of whether it is TV or the internet.
The AVMSD impose on Member States to ensure that
all videosharing platforms in their jurisdiction have
tools for users to indicate whether the videos they
upload include ads or other commercial contents.      17
Hence, platforms must ensure that influencers can use
appropriate disclosure tools on their interfaces.

    Identified loopholes

The current EU rules applicable to influencer marketing
have shown limitations, gaps and other loopholes over
the years.

First, there is still no clear definition of “influencer
marketing” under EU consumer law. This creates legal
uncertainties about the type of activities covered and
can lead to inconsistent interpretations across Member
States.
creation process. Yet not all of them are adequately
regulated. Influencers, their agencies and the brands
whose products are promoted should bear joint and
several liability to ensure compliance with applicable
rules.²⁷
Third, social media platforms make significant
revenues thanks to influencers keeping and attracting
new audiences and encouraging those to spend time
on the platforms. Social media platforms have claimed

    Second, influencer marketing involves a chain of                    to address issues arising from influencer marketing or
    different actors who all play important roles in the value

    18     In September 2025, Italy adopted guidelines and a Code of Conduct (Amendments to the guidelines referred to in resolution No. 7/24/CONS and approval of the code of conduct for influencers) applicable to influencer marketing. It specifies that influencers have at least 500,000 followers or an average
           monthly view count of one million. Its implementation will rely on monitoring systems, verification of compliance, and the application of sanctions in the
           event of violations. Penalties include fines of up to €250,000 for general violations and up to €600 000 if minors are involved.
    19     In June 2023, France adopted a law regulating influencers (French Law no. 2023-451 to prevent scams and abusive practices by influencers on social
           medias) providing a legal definition of influencer marketing. Influencers must inform their viewers of paid partnerships, either orally, through text or
           through features integrated on the social media platform. If the influencer mentions the partnership orally, in a video for example, the influencer must
           specify it again in the description in the first three hashtags associated with the post. Furthermore, the law also restricts influencer marketing for certain
           products, such as medical products and certain financial services.
    20     Spain regulates influencer marketing primarily through Law 13/2022, the General Law on Audiovisual Communication, and Royal Decree 444/2024, which
           defines “users of special relevance” on video-sharing platforms. Together, these instruments subject certain high-reach, monetised influencers to the
           audiovisual commercial communication regime, requiring that advertising — including content promoted in exchange for monetary payment or in-kind
           benefits such as free products, services or invitations — be clearly identifiable as such, within a broader framework in which both influencers and the
           brands or agencies commissioning their content may be held responsible for breaches of the rules.
    21     See for example DGGCRF in France (https://www.economie.gouv.fr/actualites/influenceurs-bilan-des-controles-2022-et-2023-de-la-dgccrf). The
           investigations revealed that 60% of influencers under scrutiny were non-compliant with consumer and advertising law and notably transparency
           requirements. Similarly, in November 2025, the Polish Office for Competition and Consumer Protection has launched two preliminary investigations into
           activities of influencers after raising “serious concerns” about influencer marketing targeted at children (https://uokik.gov.pl/en/advertising-targeted-at-children-uokik-monitors-social-media)
    22     For example, DGCCRF in France issued several fines against influencers. See Le Figaro, ‘L’influenceur Julien Tanti sanctionné pour pratiques commerciales
           trompeuses par la Répression des fraudes’, 10 March 2025. Available at: L’influenceur Julien Tanti sanctionné pour «pratiques commerciales trompeuses»
           par la Répression des fraudes
    23     In Switzerland, authorities announced the amendment of federal law to restrict food marketing to children after assessing that the voluntary Swiss
           Pledge does not go far enough but have since withdrawn their proposal – which our Swiss member FRC regrets. Available at: https://www.frc.ch/dossiers/marketing-et-malbouffe-chez-les-enfants
    24     Exemptions include sponsorships for “charitable purposes”, e.g. children’s sports, or brand marketing. See Norwegian Ministry of Children and Families,

    25     The Danish proposal was triggered, among other things, by the fact that food companies have violated the food industry’s own code of not targeting the
           advertisement of unhealthy foods to children under the age of 13.
    26     France has also put forward a proposal for a new law banning influencer marketing of ultra-fast fashion. See: Sénat français, Proposition de loi visant à
           réduire l’impact environnemental de l’industrie textile, Session 2023–2024. Available at: https://www.senat.fr/leg/ppl23-431.html
    27     Influencer agencies operate without regulation despite their central role, with surveys showing 44% of brands don’t require disclosure and 3% actively
           discourage it. See: Michaelsen, F., Collini, L. et. al., 2022, The impact of influencers on advertising and consumer protection in the Single Market, Publication for the committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO), Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies,

    ISSUES WITH INFLUENCER MARKETING:
    OLD AND NEW PRACTICES

Multifaceted hidden advertising practices
Hidden advertising practices are a form of
promotion where commercial contents are not, or
insufficiently, disclosed. This includes undisclosed
paid endorsements. Disclosing paid promotion
on social media platforms is a legal obligation for
influencers in Europe, whether companies pay them
in exchange for their advertising services, or gift them

with products or services. Hiding paid promotion
can constitute a misleading commercial practice with
penalties if influencers or brands infringe the rules.   36
Even when there is no contractual obligation between
brands, their agencies and influencers, ‘give-andtake’ attitudes may still be encouraged through paid
promotion agreements and gift-giving (i.e., sending

    30     In 2021, the Danish Competition and Consumer Protection Authority stated in its publication “Consumers benefit from visually salient standardized
           commercial disclosures on Social Media” that “it is unclear whether standardized disclosure labels implemented by various video-sharing platforms in
           order to comply with the AVMSD follow these guidelines, which could mean that influencers cannot solely rely on declaring commercial intent via a platform-integrated functionality”.

    Focus on emerging practices: a deep dive into two key sectors

Although influencer marketing is present in all sectors,
BEUC decided to focus this report on     fast fashion
and unhealthy food advertising . These two highly
problematic sectors for consumers epitomise overall
developments in influencer marketing.
On the one hand, unhealthy food marketing               41 is
inundating children and teenagers daily. Children and
teenagers are particularly vulnerable to marketers
sophisticated, subtle and convincing techniques
promoting unhealthy foods. A recent UNICEF report
shows that while television still plays a role, social media
is the top source of food and drink advertisements.
While exposure to traditional advertising (e.g., on
packaging or billboards) can vary depending on
geographical location, exposure to digital advertising is
widespread across countries and regardless of income
status. The food evidence-gathering builds up on
BEUC’s 2021 report that shed light on the many online
and offline techniques used to advertise to children
and teenagers.⁴²
On the other hand, the fast fashion industry relies
on mass production, low prices, often low-quality
materials and high sales volumes of clothing items   43.
Traders like SHEIN pose serious environmental, and
social challenges for consumers and society at large.
BEUC and its members set these issues out in an
enforcement action launched before the network of EU
Consumer Protection Authorities (CPC-Network) and
the European Commission in June 2025, highlighting
SHEIN’s use of dark patterns which contributes to
overconsumption and impulse-buying.⁴⁴

FOCUS #1: INFLUENCER MARKETING IN THE FAST
FASHION SECTOR

Spotted practices

Clothing ‘hauls’ and ‘try-on hauls’                          “Dupe” videos
‘Hauls’ are marketing practices where influencers            These are videos presenting low-cost imitations
unpack and model large quantities of clothing, thus          of designer outfits and accessories as equivalent
showcasing how much can be purchased with little             alternatives. These types of posts are likely to mislead
money. The emphasis on volume and low prices trains          consumers about the true quality and properties of the
audiences to value cheap, disposable fashion over            products. In some cases, dupe videos also compare
quality and ethics. Influencers may purchase the clothes     similar items from two different fast fashion brands, in a

Trend-based content and other seasons recommendations
Influencers buy new items to participate in short-lived online challenges or post “must-have” lists that reflect mi  -
cro-seasons, creating constant pressure to update one’s wardrobe. They often appear in different outfits in one
day, suggesting that repeating outfits is socially undesirable. This type of content typically increases during seasonal
transitions, with influencers promoting items such as “cozy fall sweaters” or “flowery summer dresses.”

Issues

Lack of transparency and undisclosed partnerships
Evidence collected show that many influencers integrate promotional content into their personal narratives. They
frequently share affiliate links (through which they earn a commission when consumers click or make a purchase),
discount codes, or “exclusive deals” as gifts to their followers. As such, they mask commercial partnerships and
pretend to make genuine recommendations. Promotional posts are often framed as expressions of personal style
rather than advertisements, blurring the line between marketing and authenticity. Several BEUC members identi              -
fied influencers telling consumers that they can get products and clothes on Temu for free with a special discount
code, or when spending a specific amount. Influencers frequently hide disclosures within hashtag lists, display them
briefly under profile pictures in reels before they disappear, or omit them entirely. Some influencers also promote

on Snapchat by Temu, where a famous influencer           on TikTok, featuring an influencer with 31,700 followers,
promotes the platform by claiming that purchases for     promoting clothes from Temu for PLN 0 (EUR 0), when
“0 kr” (“EUR 0”) is possible with her discount code,     purchasing for a specific amount.⁵²

    Toying with emotions and pushing towards over consumption
    Through carefully curated content, influencers present shopping not as a mere transactional act but as a form of
    self-care, identity-building, or emotional validation. This narrative encourages followers to purchase clothing to
    cope with stress, assert individuality, or feel socially accepted. This form of emotional influence harms consumers
    by exploiting the trust and intimacy they place in influencers to stimulate unnecessary and impulsive purchases. By
    presenting shopping as a form of self-care or a route to confidence and belonging, influencers normalise emotional
    consumption patterns that can lead to compulsive buying behaviour, financial stress, and long-term dissatisfaction.




The perceived closeness between influencers and follower, often expressed through affectionate language such as
“my darlings” or “best friends”, blurs the line between commercial endorsement and genuine personal connection.
Influencers blend personal confessions and “big sister” advice with promotion of fast fashion clothes, cultivating a
parasocial relationship in which their recommendations feel like caring guidance rather than advertising.
Influencers also use the ‘fear of missing out’ syndrome and the pressure to stay socially relevant. Gamified content,
such as showcasing massive free hauls and suggesting viewers can win or earn the same, reinforces this effect. This
is particularly concerning for younger audiences, who are more susceptible to social comparison and identity construction through consumption.

features “stories” of images and videos that disappear

Tactics such as “happy washing,” where influencers imply that fashion can make up for personal difficulties (e.g. “life
isn’t perfect, but your outfit can be”) deepen this emotional influence. Gamified messaging also fosters urgency
and addiction, such as showcasing large “free” hauls and implying viewers can receive the same, despite misleading
or inaccessible terms, as seen in certain Temu promotions. Limited-time discount codes further heighten pressure
and builds anticipation, combining emotional appeal with artificial urgency. Collectively, these techniques affect
consumer psychology, particularly among younger audiences, which may contribute to impulsive spending, material dissatisfaction, and negative mental health impacts.

Building brands image and ‘reputation washing’

Through lifestyle-oriented content, influencers reshape perceptions of fast fashion, making it appear trendy, af                          -
fordable, and widely accepted. Seen as authentic and relatable, they build trust with their audiences and lend cred
                                                                                                                                          -
ibility to companies that might have ethically problematic practices. By portraying fast fashion in a positive light,
influencers effectively rebrand ethically questionable companies, distorting consumer perceptions, undermining
informed decision-making, and encouraging impulsive overconsumption.

Influencers play a strategic role in reshaping public perceptions of fast fashion companies, helping to rehabilitate
damaged reputations and deflect criticism. In response to widespread scrutiny over labour exploitation and en                             -
vironmental harm, Shein invited six major influencers from the United States to tour its Chinese factories in 2023.
Their social media coverage reaching millions portrayed SHEIN positively, presenting a curated, sanitised image
of its operations. This marketing strategy leveraged influencers trusted status to legitimise a brand under ethical
fire.⁵⁹ The strategy extended into political discourse. During France’s 2025 Senate debate on anti-ultra-fast fashion
legislation, SHEIN mobilised influencers to shift public attention away from the law’s focus on environmental and
labour concerns. The campaign reframed the issue around consumer rights, using slogans like “fashion is a right,
not a privilege,” to oppose regulation and preserve market favourability.⁶⁰

    FOCUS #2 INFLUENCER MARKETING AND
    UNHEALTHY FOOD ADVERTISING

    Spotted practices

Child-friendly visuals
Influencers often use a style that is visually appealing
to younger audiences. It can include wearing bright,
colourful clothing, often with recognisable branding
or messages, and they often embody playful poses or
dances for an attractive, fun and youthful atmosphere.
Their content’s setting and style is often visually aligned
with trends appealing to teenagers and younger
audiences.
In Bulgaria, BNAAC found an example of a salty breadsnack brand that shows two influencers entering a
magical, imaginary world where a ketchup bottle talks
and acts like a person, guiding the characters through
the fantasy world. 63 Using talking food characters or
cartoons is a classic child-targeting technique, designed
to capture attention and create emotional attachment
to the brand. Studies have even demonstrated that
children think a product tasted better when a licensed
media character appeared on it.⁶⁴




Taste tests and flavour challenges
Many brands use influencers to promote their product
ranges and flavours. Influencers post taste tests and
ask followers for their favourites, encouraging them
to try these products and engage with their content
by commenting or by posting themselves and using
a hashtag. Food brands like to use taste tests as a
marketing technique as it seems like influencers are
giving genuine product reviews, when the incentive
to offer positive reviews is clearly given by the paid
promotion or gifts.
In Sweden,   Sveriges Konsumenter   found one
example of an energy drink brand working with a
fitness and lifestyle influencer who is playing a “guess
the flavour” game with his friend.  65 The interaction
feels spontaneous and playful, resembling a genuine
interaction between peers. The tone and short format
mimic the style of challenge videos on social media and
strongly appeal to a teen audience by inviting them to
compare flavours and debate in the comments which
one is best. Energy drinks can pose serious risks for
children and teenagers as they contain high amounts
of caffeine and sugar.

Discount codes and giveaways                             ;SORTEO!
Influencers often offer discount codes for certain
fast-food restaurants. They promote either the           HARIBO                  PRIXTON
food products themselves or the brand and offer
personalised discount codes to their followers.                                  ARIBO
Influencers are increasingly “hosting” these
competitions or giveaways organised by brands. To                          HARIBO
enter the competition followers often have to follow              Os tios de Oore

quickly, especially among a young audience.

influencers promoting hotels and venues, as well as
gamers who stream their sessions or promote gaming
products. Influencers may use food products to align
with their own content and follower base by adding
their unique spin.
Another common way for influencers to advertise
food and beverage products is by either incorporating
them into a recipe or pairing them with a dish they are
cooking or getting delivered. This food pairing strategy
normalises the product as part of regular, homecooked meals, reinforcing habitual consumption.
In Portugal, DECO found that Cola-Cola ran a campaign
in March 2025 praising how the beverage goes well with
different dishes such as burgers, sushi, and pasta. They
relied on two influencers and an influencer couple, who
have over 3.1 million followers combined. The same
campaign also relied heavily on daily relatable situations
of friends and family having dinner together and
making Cola-Cola feel like a natural, everyday product.
One video shows an influencer looking into his empty
fridge and opening the door to let his mother in with a
home-cooked pasta dish and two Cola-Cola bottles. 67        POV: Quando a tua avó te
This family-oriented narrative is simple, humorous, and     surpreende de forma épica

Other influencers associate food products with special occasions
or seasonal events.
In Sweden,   Sveriges Konsumenter shows two lifestyle
influencers and a former professional skier promoting biscuits
while skiing together carrying the cookie brand logo.  68 The

holiday spirit and nostalgia, turning these biscuits into part of the     AVSHITT 3.

Dance challenges and comedy sketches                            jag
Some influencers use techniques that engage a young audience,
such as dance challenges. These simple choreographies to trendy
songs encourage the audience to reproduce the dance and the        NE
video to go viral.

In Bulgaria, BNAAC found an example from a very popular soft
drink and snack brand.⁶⁹ The products feature a large and bright
teddy bear logo that looks very appealing to a young audience.
The brand invited influencers to perform a choreography in front     DL
of a supermarket while holding soft drink bottles. It used a popular song adapted to feature a play-on-words. The content format
(dance, song remix and humour) is optimised for social media virality, encouraging engagement from a young audience.

                           Some influencers also create short sketches or prank videos
                           that feature food products or brand promotion blending comedy content with food advertising. Many re-create relatable

                           found one example of a young influencer DJ who created a fun
                           and light-hearted campaign for Burger King. 70 The influencer
                           performs a catchy and original song in a fast-food restaurant

                           crunches”), turning the advertisement into a music video with
                     N     multiple actors singing and dancing while eating burgers.




Emotional messaging (‘treat yourself’)
Many brands use emotional messaging to advertise
their food products. Our examples show brands using
influencers to associate having a sugary beverage or
snack as a reward or treat for oneself or self-care.
In Spain,  OCU found an example with a 21-year-old
influencer praising Cola-Cola for helping her getting
through an exam period, 71 while our Swedish member
Sveriges Konsumenter  saw an actress from a show
popular with a young audience, who comes home
to a fridge stacked full of Cola-Cola bottles with the
caption reading ‘it’s the small things in life’. BEUC
submitted both examples as complaints to the EU
Pledge and the Panel did not consider either to be
marketing to children, only aiming ‘teens and young
adults. Both Coca-Cola Spain and Sweden shared with
us segmentation statistics of the influencers’ followers
showing that between 11% (out of 204 000 followers
for the Spanish influencer) and over 16% of followers
(out of 251 000 followers for the Swedish influencer)
are under 18. In both cases those are still a considerable
number of minors.
Advocating for a good cause
Food brands often pair with influencers to raise
awareness for a good cause.
In Spain, OCU spotted a mass influencer posting about
McDonald’s awareness raising activities on a relief
project following the 2024 floods in Valencia.   72 The
campaign ran over a few days in March 2025, with 23
stories in one single day, featuring celebrities and
influencers totalling a following of over 16 million.
This made McDonald’s an inescapable presence,
particularly in children’s digital environment.  Even
though the posts and stories did not feature any
McDonald’s products, the campaign associated the
brand with charity and community work, and solidarity
– a form of ‘social washing’. By relying heavily on
football players who are often role models for children
and teenagers, McDonald’s reinforces their appeal to
young people. BEUC submitted a complaint to the EU
Pledge about this campaign which the panel deemed
inadmissible because the ad does not display a non-compliant product.

Invitations to events and festivals
Some food brands invite influencers to music festivals or sports events to                  TOMORROWLAND
                                                                                            WINTER 2025
promote both the event itself and their brand through prominent featuring of products.
In Switzerland, Fédération Romande des Consommateurs found a campaign in March 2025 where Cola-Cola worked together with 10 influencers
to promote festival Tomorrowland Winter which they are a partner of.           73
Influencers posted from the festival, featuring and drinking Cola-Cola
products and thanking the brand for this experience.
                                                                                            Paal Mack

Gamified content and partnering with other brands
The evidence-gathering uncovered 11 examples from Portugal, Spain and Bulgaria, of collaborations between food
brands and the Minecraft movie creating a direct link between a food brand and child-friendly entertainment. Minecraft is one of the most popular games among children and teenagers with 20% of players under the age of 15. 74
The Minecraft brand brings strong child appeal through its blocky visuals, playful world-building, and widespread
recognition among young audiences. Integrating unhealthy food products into the Minecraft narrative makes
them appear as part of the gaming world, normalising consumption by associating unhealthy foods with play, fun,
and rewards.
In Portugal, DECO found one example of McDonald’s               In Bulgaria, BNAAC spotted posts of influencers using

                       Our analysis has found multiple examples of on-site marketing events
                       in fast-food restaurants, including with influencers and artists.
                       In Switzerland, Fédération Romande des Consommateurs has found
                       two examples of McDonald’s inviting an influencer and an artist to
                       in-store events that predominantly featured children.  79 A 14-yearold Swiss DJ and kidfluencer played in a McDonald’s fast-food outlet
                       twice. By using a minor as the centre of the event, the brand directly
                       appeals to children, positioning the fast-food outlet as a fun place for
                       young talents. The post caption says, “a pleasure to mix in such a crazy atmosphere and share my passion with the youngest”. The videos

Issues with unhealthy food marketing
While children and teenagers are vulnerable to influencer marketing in general, the food sector in particular needs
strong legislation as the childhood overweight and obesity epidemic puts children at a much higher risk of developing serious health problems. 94 Many children and teenagers use digital media every day and algorithms have
now bypassed children and teenagers’ media literacy. They are closely tailored to inundate them with increasingly
harmful content as well as exposure to unhealthy practices and products such as high fat, salt and sugar (HFSS)
foods and drinks.

78     Screenshot taken 10 April 2025.



Pushing overconsumption and creating
“cravings”
2025 is a historic turning point as for the first time
obesity among school children (aged 5 -19) surpassed
underweight.⁸⁰ One in three children in Europe is
living with overweight or obesity and the World
Health Organization has ‘unequivocally’ linked this
trend to marketing of unhealthy foods high in fat,
sugar and salt. 81 There is clear evidence showing that
food marketing influences preferences, demand and
consumption among children and young people and
consequently their eating habits.      82 The increase in
powerful advertising techniques, as well as constant
exposure to unhealthy food marketing has become
ubiquitous for children growing up in Europe. This is
why regulating food marketing to children is a crucial
measure to improve children’s health and wellbeing –
well into their adult life – by making sure the healthy
choice is the easiest, regardless of their parents’
financial situation and knowledge.
Constant exposure to unhealthy food content may
not only lead to unhealthy dietary patterns but also
stimulate and normalise overconsumption of such
foods. Influencers praising a product’s tastiness,
experiencing pleasure and satisfaction eating it increase
the viewer’s desire to consume it. Tasty-looking foods,
oozing with fat and sugar, close-ups, sizzling sounds,
or ice-cold sparkling drinks for instance, work well with
visual platforms such as Instagram. This stimulates the
audience’s sensory engagement, evoking tastes and
smells. Studies show that exposure to unhealthy food
marketing increases hunger and cravings for both
children⁸³ and adults.⁸⁴
Lack of transparency and undisclosed
commercial partnerships
Out of the over 300 examples of influencer marketing
of unhealthy foods BEUC received from its members,
only a fraction disclosed their content’s paid promotion
nature by adding ‘ad’, ‘product placement’ or the paid
partnership label of the platform.
67% of the monitored posts and stories, which
seemed to have clear commercial intent, did
not disclose a partnership with the brand,
neither as a gift nor as a paid promotion.


Among these, temporary stories predominantly did
not feature any type of disclosure. Stories are only
visible for 24 hours on Instagram and do not have a
visible caption by default, this makes the enforcement
of disclosure guidelines difficult. Influencers therefore
need to disclose the paid promotion in a text box in the
story itself, which was mostly missing
Even if influencers disclose paid promotion, studies
have shown limited potential in minimising harmful
effects of the unhealthy food content they promote.
In a 2019 trial, children exposed to unhealthy foods’
influencer marketing consumed more calories
after seeing content featuring a marketed product
regardless of whether the influencer did or did not
disclose a paid partnership with the brand. Children
who viewed content with a disclosed partnership even
consumed 41% more of the marketed snack compared
to the control group.⁸⁵
This evidence clearly shows that, in addition to
transparency rules that need to be harmonised, the
products themselves need to be regulated. While
disclosing the advertisement to viewers serves the
purpose of transparency and information, product
regulation serves to protect children and their short-and long-term health.

and self-regulation, e.g. through codes of conduct or
initiatives like the EU Pledge.
BEUC and members submitted 13 complaints to the EU
Pledge about Instagram influencer marketing content
by Pledge signatories which featured techniques we
considered to be unhealthy food marketing to children.


The Pledge Secretariat deemed two of our complaints
inadmissible because they “did not feature non-compliant products”: the McDonald’s campaign with
footballers and influencers with a combined following
of over 16 million followers, and the McDonald’s
Minecraft collaboration (both examples described on
p.24-25). The Pledge Panel concluded that none of our
11 remaining complaints were examples of marketing
to children and that all content was compliant with
EU Pledge requirements. However, many Pledge
signatories provided us with numbers of influencers’
audiences and viewers of specific posts and stories.
These numbers show that a significant number of
children and teenagers see these posts and stories (up
to 16% of viewers for one example were under 18 years
old), even if they may not be the main target group.
This report focusing on influencer marketing confirms
BEUC’s 2021 analysis of the EU Pledge’s shortcomings.
Marketing restrictions put in place by the EU Pledge
are so weak that food and drink companies are allowed
to continue marketing unhealthy products to children,
failing to protect them.
What about brand marketing?

Under self-regulatory models such as the EU Pledge,
companies selling HFSS foods can continue marketing
their brand to children as long as advertisements do not
contain products themselves. Examples of unhealthy
food marketing national regulation such as the new
ban in Norway, still exempt brand marketing.
For the first time, a recent study has found evidence
that brand-only advertising also affects what children
eat, even when foods served to children were not the
same as those just seen by study participants and did not
have branding information. 86 Similarly, a 2018 study in
Australia found that children eat on average 50 calories
more after watching unhealthy food advertising and do
not compensate by eating less at later meals. The study
found that this amount is high enough for these children
to eventually become overweight in their adult life.  All
this shows the immense power of unhealthy food ads
have on children, and that any regulation exempting
brand marketing is insufficient to protect children.  As
already stressed in BEUC’s 2021 report,  policymakers
must restrict brand marketing, especially for those
brands predominantly selling HFSS foods , to avoid
food companies simply highlighting healthier options
in their marketing or omitting specific food products
in their advertisements, whilst continuing to sell high
amounts of HFSS foods.

The need to protect children and teenagers alike
While many social media platforms officially require
their users to be over the age of 13, this has proved
ineffective to protect children from online content
that is not appropriate for their age. Children can easily
circumvent age verification methods without their
parents’ knowledge. Given how easy it is for underage
children and teenagers to be active on social media,
one can safely assume that advertising designed to
reach teenagers will also reach younger children. At
the same time, teenagers are at a life stage where they
are highly sensitive to social acceptance and rewards,
two techniques frequently used in digital marketing.
At EU level, the EU Pledge currently only includes
guidelines on marketing to children under the age
of 13, which fails to protect teenagers who are still
particularly vulnerable to the marketing of HFSS
foods. Thus, regulators should define a child as anyone
under the age of 18 years old, as the WHO and the UN
Convention of the Rights of the Child recommend, and
in line with most countries’ legal definition of a child.


    86     As of 20 November, the study has not been published yet. See The Guardian, ‘Children eat more after seeing just five minutes of junk food ads, study
           finds’, 11 May 2025. Available at: https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/11/children-eat-more-after-seeing-just-five-minutes-of-junk-foodads-study-finds

   Zoom in on food supplements
   Influencers increasingly promote food supplements on social media, where investigations reveal serious problems in transparency, dosage safety, and audience-targeting. In Germany, a study⁸⁸ analysing 105 supplements promoted on Instagram found that about two-thirds exceeded recommended maximum daily amounts (as defined by
   the German Federal Risk Assessment Centre and EFSA),             without any warnings about overdosing . Many posts
   were not labelled as advertising and presented supplements as “miracle cures”, with no mention of contraindica     -
   tions, or dosage risks. An evaluation by a German Food Safety Authority found that out of a total of 565 stories by
   influencers, about 90% of the health claims made were classified as inadmissible by the authorities.  89 Influencers
   therefore hardly comply with the provisions of the Health Claims Regulation
   This trend is particularly concerning among younger audiences, who often perceive influencers as authentic and
   trustworthy health figures. Convinced they are doing something healthy, many overlook the commercial motives
   and scientific uncertainty behind such advice. This false sense of legitimacy increases the risk of overconsumption.

   Many fitness influencers build a massive online following     A Belgian beauty influencer is promoting “Strength
   promoting high-protein products and workout                   and growth” gummies, which she described as having
   supplements through food supplement brands and                “incredible results on her hair”.  91 These raspberryeven their own brands. Influencers claim that creatine        flavoured gummies, enriched with zinc, selenium
   makes you stronger, whey protein builds muscle, and           and horsetail extract, are marketed as vegan, natural
   others boost energy or recovery, suggesting that              solutions for stronger, shinier hair.
   combining them speeds up results. One example BEUC’s
   German member Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband
   found shows a popular fitness influencer in a video
   titled “everything you need to know about creatine”
   claiming “side effects none”.⁹⁰

Many people consume food supplements without real
need, often influenced by marketing that creates a
false sense of necessity. This perception encourages
unnecessary consumption and overlooks that long-term or excessive use may carry certain risks. According
to many public health authorities, food supplements
do not substitute for a balanced and varied diet and
are rarely necessary, especially for children. Spanish
consumer group OCU recommends that food
supplements should not be given to children at all,
unless a paediatrician consider that deficiencies cannot
be covered by improving diet or lifestyle habits.⁹²
Over time, some supplements could contribute to
cardiovascular strain, digestive issues, or mild liver
and kidney stress. 93 Muscle-building products high in
caffeine or stimulants may cause palpitations, sleep
problems, or dehydration, 94 while beauty or weightcontrol supplements containing high levels of vitamin
A or iron could, if overused, lead to vitamin A toxicity 95
or liver strain.96,⁹⁷, 98
Supplement marketing does more than influence
physical health, it can significantly affect mental
health, especially among children and teenagers. As
our Portuguese member DECO explains, exposure to
idealised body images and beauty standards online
can negatively impact self-esteem, increasing the risk
of anxiety, eating disorders,⁹⁹ and other mental health
challenges. Findings from Norwegian BEUC member
Forbrukerrådet¹⁰⁰ in 2024 show clear gender differences
in supplement use, reflecting how these products are
promoted online. Boys are often targeted with products
emphasising strength and performance, while girls are
more frequently exposed to supplements linked to
beauty and weight control. These patterns not only
reinforce traditional gender norms but also contribute
to unequal psychological pressures, highlighting
the need to consider the mental health implications
of supplement promotion alongside physical risks.
Forbrukerrådet have also found that unhealthy foods,
dieting products and fitness advice are often presented
side by side in the same posts highlighting that all these
practices contribute to unhealthy eating habits and
body image.
The combination of opaque influencer practices,
frequent overdosing, weak and unclear regulation, and
audience tailoring creates a potent public health risk,
particularly among younger users.

    CONCLUSION: INFLUENCER MARKETING
    BEYOND THESE TWO SECTORS AND FUTURE
    EU REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS

Evidence collected show that influencer marketing
is multifaceted and exposes consumersespecially
children and teenagersto fleeting marketing contents
that often lack transparency. These posts and videos
can be risky for consumers as they can trigger over-and impulsive consumption or creates a false sense of
trust in influencers’ advice.
The practices and issues highlighted in this evidencegathering are by no means limited to the fast fashion
and food sector. This is especially the case of influencers
promoting financial investments or products such as
crypto currencies. A consumer survey published by
BEUC in October 2025 including data from 11 European

countries show that 21,1% of survey respondents use
social media and 14% rely on influencers as a source
of information for their personal finances.  101 While
the level of trust is not as high as it is for advice from
bank staff or friends and family, most respondents still
found the information received from social media and
influencers useful.¹⁰²
In parallel, several measures have been taken in the past
years at national level to regulate influencer marketing
of financially risky products. France limited influencer
promotions of risky financial products, such as crypto
assets, only to products authorised by the French
Financial Market Authority and where the influencer
obtained a licence from the authority financial agent.¹⁰³
Similarly, the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets
clarified ‘finfluencers’ need a licence to give financial
advice and that there is a ban on inducements, i.e.
an influencer cannot accept fees for promoting
investment products.¹⁰⁴
Spain and Belgium recently introduced new rules
which oblige influencer promotion for crypto assets to
prominently disclose the risks associated with investing
in these assets and include a clear risk warning.    The
                                                105 106
Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets published
guidelines for finfluencers including warnings to give
personal investment advice only if under a license, to
be transparent about personal commercial interest
and to refuse fees for bringing clients through affiliated
links or referrals (as there is a ban on inducements in
place in the Netherlands).
Looking beyond financial services, effective legislative
measures to protect consumers from the risks posed
by influencer marketing are necessary. The European

    H                                                               Digital Fairness Act, and the evaluation of the
                                                                    Audiovisual Media Services Directive expected for the
                                                                    end of 2026 are opportunities to address this problem.
