Historically, the study of mental health has \nbeen dominated by psychology and psychiatry which \nhas led to a “psychiatrization” [ 1] of mental health and \nillness, approaching the matter from a clinical perspec -\ntive. In this special collection, we adopt the World Health \nOrganization’s (WHO) encompassing definition of men -\ntal health as “a state of mental well-being that enables \npeople to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abili -\nties, learn well and work well, and contribute to their \ncommunity” [ 2]. The WHO’s description of mental \nhealth acknowledges that “mental health is broader than \nthe lack of a mental disorder” , and encompasses mental \ndisorders, psychosocial disabilities, and “other mental \nstates associated with significant distress, impairment in \nfunctioning, or risk of self-harm” [ 2]. This definition also Introduction\nThis special collection brings together the three broad \nthemes of mental health, discourse and stigma as they are \nexamined through sociolinguistic lenses. We first pres -\nent what we mean by mental health, discourse and stigma \nand discuss the interrelationships between these con -\ncepts. We then offer a brief overview of existing sociolin -\nguistic research on mental health and stigma and identify \ncontinuing areas of under-research that we hope this spe -\ncial collection will contribute to. Finally, we ask the ques -\ntions of ‘why?’ and ‘so what?’ in relation to sociolinguistic \nresearch on mental health and stigma and outline some \nways in which this growing area of research could mean -\ningfully contribute to broader professional practice in \npsychology and psychiatry.BMC Psychology\n*Correspondence:\nOlga Zayts-Spence\nzayts@hku.hk\n1School of English, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong KongAbstract\nIn this editorial to the special collection “Mental Health, Discourse and Stigma” we outline the concepts of mental, \nhealth, discourse and stigma as they are examined through sociolinguistic lenses. We examine the sociolinguistic \napproach to mental health and stigma and discuss the different theoretical frameworks and methodological \napproaches that have been applied in such contexts. Sociolinguistics views mental health and stigma as \ndiscursively constructed and constituted, i.e. they are both manifest, negotiated, reinforced or contested in the \nlanguage that people use. We highlight existing gaps in sociolinguistic research and outline how it could enrich \nresearch in psychology and psychiatry and contribute to professional practice. Specifically, sociolinguistics provides \nwell-established methodological tools to research the ‘voices’ of people with a history of mental ill health, their \nfamily, carers and mental health professionals in both online and off-line contexts. This is vital to develop targeted \ninterventions and to contribute to de-stigmatization of mental health. To conclude, we highlight the importance of \ntransdisciplinary research that brings together expertise in psychology, psychiatry and sociolinguistics.\nKeywords  Mental health, Discourse, Stigma, SociolinguisticsMental Health, Discourse and Stigma\nOlga Zayts-Spence1*, David Edmonds1 and Zoe Fortune1"}, {"page": 2, "text": "Page 2 of 5\nZayts-Spence et al. BMC Psychology           (2023) 11:180 \nemphasizes the close interrelationship between mental \nhealth and social aspects of life.\nClosely intertwined with the concept of mental health \nis the concept of stigma that has also been widely \nresearched in psychology, psychiatry, as well as sociol -\nogy. In his seminal essay, sociologist Erving Goffman [ 3] \ndefines stigma as “an attribute that is deeply discrediting” . \nStigmatized individuals are often perceived as being dif -\nferent and “lesser” than “the normals” [ 3]. Contemporary \ndefinitions of mental health stigma largely follow Goff -\nman’s work, highlighting its discrediting attributes and \nthe negative attitudes attached to it [ 4, 5]. These attitudes \nalso extend to people in the immediate surroundings, \nsuch as family [ 6], and even mental health professionals \n[7, 8]. This is known as associative or courtesy stigma, \ni.e. being stigmatized because of a relationship to an \nindividual experiencing a mental health problem [ 9]. \nLong describes associative stigma experienced by men -\ntal health professionals who are stigmatized because of \nbeing “attached to their patients and […] positioned as \na less prestigious branch of a broader medical profes -\nsion” [ 7]. Shipman and Zayts discuss an extreme case of \nsuch associative stigma where a psychiatrist practising in \nHong Kong is stigmatized by his own family for working \nwith mentally ill people and for fear of ‘transmission’ of a \nmental illness [ 8].\nPsychological research on mental health stigma has \nburgeoned since Goffman’s study. Focusing on the \n“micro-level social interactions” , this research has exam -\nined the causes of stigma, its cognitive dimensions, the \nconsequences and the coping responses [ 10, 11]. Fewer \nsociological studies existed [ 10], but following a much-\ncited publication by Link and Phelan [ 12], sociological \nresearch has proliferated. Link and Phelan re-defined \nstigma, surmising it to four processes: labelling differ -\nences, stereotyping differences, separating the stigma -\ntized from ‘us’ , and discriminating against the stigmatized \n[12]. By highlighting the processes of discrimination and \nseparation of the stigmatized from ‘us’ , Link and Phelan \nessentially expanded the definition of stigma to the \nmacro-level social processes, such as social inequality, \ndiscrimination based on one’s mental health status, and \ndiscriminating societal ideologies. These macro-social \nforms of stigma are known as structural stigma [ 11]. \nWorkplace settings are one example when employers \nare hesitant to hire or promote people with a history of \nmental health problems, although these discriminatory \nattitudes are typically subtle and indirect. Sociological \nresearch has largely focused on how different types of \nstigma contribute to inequalities and impact social rela -\ntionships between different groups [ 10].\nSociolinguistics studies the interrelationship between \nlanguage and society [ 13] of which discourse is a cen -\ntral sociolinguistic concept. It is equally as nebulous and multifaceted as the concepts of mental health and stigma. \nDiscourse may refer to:\n  –A stretch of language above a clause or a sentence \nlevel [ 14].\n –Language used by speakers to covey and negotiate \ncertain meanings and achieve particular purposes \n[15].\n –Language used to represent various social practices, \nsocial actors and ideologies [ 16, 17].\nRelating these different interpretations of discourse to \nmental health contexts, in its micro-analytic understand -\ning discourse may refer, for example, to negative ste -\nreotypical attributes, such as ‘mad’ , ‘crazy’ , and  ‘insane’ . \nCulturally, there exist striking differences in how mental \nhealth disorders are described, although negative con -\nnotations typically prevail. For example, the term 精神\n分裂症  in Chinese (jīng-shén-fēn liè zhèn ɡ, schizophre -\nnia) has a literal translation of ‘the split-mind disease’ . \nThis term is heavily stigmatizing. Substantial efforts have \nbeen made by mental health professionals in Hong Kong \nto introduce less stigmatizing terms, such as 思覺失調  \n(sī jué shī tiáo, psychosis) that translates as ‘thought and \nperceptual dysregulation’ [ 18].\nIn relation to discourse as ‘language-in-use’ , the follow -\ning example from an interview with a psychiatrist illus -\ntrates how the diagnosis of a ‘schizophrenic patient’ is \nused to account for the tragic event of mass killing that \nhas marked, in this psychiatrist’s words, “a milestone” \nin the development of psychiatric services in Hong \nKong. It is an objectivized, ‘clinical’ account of a men -\ntal health disorder and its impact on one’s behaviour. It \nalso highlights a wider societal impact in response to the \nrecounted incident.\nExample 1  Psy – psychiatrist; I – interviewer .\n6. Psy: Yes. The most well known in Hong Kong is \nthis 1982 tragedy […] Schizophrenic patient, young \nman killed his mother and sister at home [.] and \nthen went down with two knives and entered a \nkindergarten and killed four more.\n11. I: Children?\n12. Psy: Four kids and wounded forty something. \n[…] This incident created, it may be regarded as \na milestone for the development of the service, \nbecause after this incident all the society turned \nattention to mental health, mental patients.\nThe last approach to discourse foregrounds how men -\ntal health is constructed through social practices. Mental \nhealth and mental health stigma are “socially and dis -\ncursively constituted” [ 19] with a bidirectional relation -\nship between discourse and social practices. Crudely \nspeaking, discourse is the ‘mirror’ through which social \npractices and ideologies become evident. For example, \ndifferent linguistic choices, such as the use of derogative, "}, {"page": 3, "text": "Page 3 of 5\nZayts-Spence et al. BMC Psychology           (2023) 11:180 \ndirect or figurative language to talk about mental health, \nreflect the dominant societal practice and ideologies. In \nthe reverse, ways of communicating about mental health \nimpact social practices and ideologies. One example \ncould be media portrayals of mental health as both a \nreflection of prevalent societal ideologies and ways to \nimpact them. These different conceptualizations of dis -\ncourse have been employed in sociolinguistic studies of \nmental health and mental health stigma.\nSociolinguistic research on mental health and mental \nhealth stigma\nIn this special collection, we use the term sociolinguistics \nbroadly to include linguistic approaches and method -\nologies as diverse as corpus linguistics, different types of \ndiscourse analysis (e.g. thematic and critical), conversa -\ntion analysis, narrative inquiry, to name just a few. While \nthese approaches conceptualise discourse differently, \nmost sociolinguistic studies on mental health and men -\ntal health stigma take a social constructivist view, viewing \nlanguage as a means of constructing social reality. Socio -\nlinguistic studies include quantitative, qualitative and \nmixed methods studies. They examine diverse discourse \ndata, from interactions in clinical contexts, to online \ninteractions between members of mental health support \ngroups, to large media corpora. Each of these different \ntypes of data provides insights into different aspects of \nmental health and has both strengths and limitations.\nArguably, one of the most potent sociolinguistic \napproaches to mental health research to date has been \ncorpus linguistics [ 19–23]. Corpus linguistics refers to \nmethods that use computerized tools (e.g. Wordsmith, \nSketch Engine) to analyse large collections of data (cor -\npora). While the corpus size could be substantial, the use \nof tools allows consistent and fairly easy identification \nof patterns in the data [ 1]. Another common sociolin -\nguistic approach is critical discourse analysis (CDA) [ 24, \n25]. For example, Price uses corpus linguistics and CDA \nto interrogate news reports on mental health in the UK \nfrom 1984 to 2014 [ 26]. Substantial corpus data delve \ninto media’s portrayals of mental health, and how mental \nhealth stigma is created and perpetuated by media.\nNotably, sociolinguistic research often includes the \n‘voices’ of under-represented, vulnerable or under-\nresearched demographic groups. For example, Galinsky’s \nand colleagues’ research focuses on discourses surround -\ning male depression and suicide [ 27–29]. Societal ideolo -\ngies around men as strong and powerful often stop men \nfrom seeking help and opening up about their mental \nhealth struggles. Sociolinguistic research has much to \ncontribute to elucidating these dominant ideologies and \nsupport organizations targeting men’s mental health \n(e.g. Mind UK or Manup). It could also contribute to \nunderstanding groups ‘associated’ with people with a history of mental ill health. For example, Ziółkowskaa \nand Galasiński, examine the narratives of children of \nfathers who died by suicide and how they deal with both \nbereavement of their deceased parent and the stigma \nattached to death by suicide [ 29].\nThese are just a few examples of previous and ongo -\ning sociolinguistic research, and in this special col -\nlection we welcome contributions that apply different \ntheoretical frameworks and methodological approaches \nin sociolinguistics.\nThe ‘why?’ and the ‘so what?’ of sociolinguistic research on \nmental health and mental health stigma\nThis brief overview of sociolinguistic research points to \nsome of the possible applications of research to profes -\nsional practice. Sociolinguistic research focuses on dis -\ncourses of mental health. These discourses are powerful, \nthey are the means to talk about mental health, the locale \nwhere mental health issues are manifest, the means to \nseek and offer help, and the ways to offer education and \ndevelop interventions. They are also the means to chal -\nlenge and contest negative ideologies. De-stigmatisation \nof mental health can be achieved through structural \nchanges (e.g. offering equal employment opportunities) \nbut most, if not all, social activities and practices are \nmediated through language. Therefore, sociolinguis -\ntic research continues to make a strong contribution to \nmental health de-stigmatization, research and practice.\nThere is an increasing emphasis in psychology and \npsychiatry on participatory research, including with \nvulnerable demographic groups [ 30]. As this editorial \nemphasizes, a strength of current sociolinguistic research \nis that it investigates the ‘voices’ of different groups of \npeople affected by mental ill health. Established sociolin -\nguistic approaches (e.g. narrative inquiry, rhetorical dis -\ncourse analysis) provide tools to examine different types \nof accounts for the social actions that people perform, \nwhy and when people give accounts, and the language \nthat they use when they do it. Investigating these data is \nimportant to develop targeted interventions for different \ngroups of people affected by mental ill health.\nSociolinguistic research also ‘weaves together’ the \nmicro-interactions with other contexts, the meso (e.g. \ninstitutional) and the macro (societal), bringing personal \nand the social aspects of mental health together to pro -\nvide a more holistic picture.\nOur brief overview has identified research gaps. There \nremains a paucity of empirical sociolinguistic research \nthat uses real-life interactional data in face-to-face \ncommunicative encounters in mental health contexts, \nfor example, in counselling or psychotherapy encoun -\nters. This may be partly due to ethical considerations of \naccess and the use of sensitive data (for exceptions, see, \nfor example, Lavie and Nakash) [ 31]. Examining these "}, {"page": 4, "text": "Page 4 of 5\nZayts-Spence et al. BMC Psychology           (2023) 11:180 \ntypes of data allows exploring in detail how social actions \nare accomplished in situ , that is, in real time during an \ninteraction, for example, how diagnosis or possible treat -\nment negotiations are accomplished. There is also limited \nresearch on inter-professional communication in mental \nhealth contexts which could examine the linguistic rep -\nertoires of professional practices, professional ethos, and \nhow diagnoses or treatment recommendations are nego -\ntiated inter-professionally, among other issues. Research \ncited in this editorial mostly comes from Anglophone \ncontexts. Research from ‘global peripheries’ [ 32] remains \nscarce. While there are a few exceptions, more research \nfrom other geographical contexts is called for [ 33].\nTo conclude, there are ample opportunities for trans-\ndisciplinary research that brings together expertise in \npsychology, psychiatry and sociolinguistics. While dis -\ncursive psychology, for example, has long been con -\ncerned with investigating issues pertaining to psychology \nthrough language, sociolinguistics offers more versatile \nand nuanced ways of doing it by offering a range of dif -\nferent approaches and methodologies. In this special \ncollection we welcome contributions that demonstrate \nthe value of sociolinguistic research and how it could \nenhance existing research and practice in psychology and \npsychiatry. We invite contributions that draw on diverse \nempirical data from different clinical and non-clinical \ncontexts and that focus on different mental health con -\nditions. We also welcome authors working in diverse \nsociocultural contexts whose work could advance our \nunderstanding of the cultural aspects present in dis -\ncourses of mental health and stigma. It is through such \ntrans-disciplinary effort that we can challenge the exist -\ning social practices and ideologies of mental health and \nultimately contribute to addressing some long-standing \nsocietal issues of discrimination and stigmatization of \npeople with mental health issues.\nAcknowledgements\nNot applicable.\nAuthor contributions\nOlga Zayts-Spence wrote the paper, David Edmonds and Zoe Fortune \nreviewed the paper.\nFunding\nThe writing of this paper was fully supported by the Collaborative Research \nFunding (CRF) of the Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong (project \nC7086-21G).\nAvailability of Data and Materials\nNot applicable.\nDeclarations\nEthical approval and consent to participate\nNot applicable.\nConsent to publish\nNot applicable.Conflict of interest\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\nReceived: 2 May 2023 / Accepted: 17 May 2023\nReferences\n1.
