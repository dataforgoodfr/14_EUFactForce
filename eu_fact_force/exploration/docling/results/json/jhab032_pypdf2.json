However, it is much less clear what mental health means in all \nthese efforts and whether there even is a single concept underlying them. \nSometimes the initiatives for the sake of mental health are aimed just at re-\nducing mental illness, thus implicitly identifying mental health with the ab-\nsence of diagnosable psychiatric disease. More ambitiously, there are also \nprominent initiatives in public health and policy that adopt positive def-\ninitions identifying mental health with psychic or even overall well-being. \nNevertheless, those looking for an explicit agreed-upon definition will be \ndisappointed.\nIn academic philosophy, and the philosophy of psychiatry in particular, \ndiscussions predominantly focus on the status of mental illness—whether \nit designates a natural kind or instead a social kind, whether classifications \nof disorders such as the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM-5) should be \nbased on symptoms rather than on underlying causes, and whether pharma-\nceutically driven interventions have too high of a profile by comparison to \ntalk therapy.1 These are important and fascinating issues, and mental health \nconnects with them all. However, in the case of mental disorders, these \ndiscussions are based on psychiatric practice: for example, the depressive \ndisorders can be defined by persistent and debilitating sadness and listless-\nness. Notably, there is no corresponding uncontroversial source for the con-\ntent of claims about mental health—there is no DSM for health. This is why \nwhat it means to be healthy is not at the forefront of today’s philosophy of \npsychiatry.2\nAt the same time, the definition of mental health is of deep philosophical \nas well as practical importance. On the practical side, if mental health is a \nstate of well-being, efforts to promote it will likely adopt different outcome \nmeasures and methods of management, with different levels of trust invested \nin traditional psychiatric approaches. On the philosophical side, it is critical \nto start a conversation that, while implicit throughout the history of phil-\nosophy, has yet to happen explicitly: is mental health identical to well-being, \nis it one of its constituents, or a precondition for it?\nThe goal of our present discussion is to map out the goalposts of such \na conversation. We do so by adopting something of a Goldilocks strategy. \nWe identify a definition of mental health that is clearly too thin and un-\ndemanding—mental health as absence of mental illness—and a definition \nthat is too ambitious and too demanding—mental health as the state of \ngeneral well-being across all aspects of social and personal life. There are \ncompelling reasons to reject both: the first one ties mental health too closely \nto the controversial concepts and methods of psychiatry, while the second \none threatens to set up an impossible ideal, to medicalize unhappiness, and \nto dress up controversial philosophical judgments about the good life in the \npretense of scientific objectivity. Mental Health Without Well-being 685"}, {"page": 3, "text": "It is this latter reason that led philosopher Simon Keller to pronounce \nthe positive ideal of mental health to be dangerous—he points out that the \nnature of well-being is a matter of ethical and personal reflection and as such \nadmits of great diversity. Once well-being becomes a condition of mental \nhealth, this invites scientific and medical recipes for good life, which are at \nbest invalid and at worst oppressive.3 We readily agree that this is the danger \nof defining mental health in terms of well-being, but it does not have to be \nso. We sketch out a more attractive middle position. On this view, mental \nhealth is a primary good, that is, the psychological preconditions of pursuing \nany conception of well-being. This definition, we argue, is independently \nplausible and not dangerous.\nII. THE NEGATIVE DEFINITION\nIt makes sense to start by examining the minimalist position. It is based on \na deeply plausible, almost tautological, observation: it is the business of \nmedicine to treat disease and when this is successful, we have health. Since \npsychiatry is the branch of medicine dedicated to treating mental illness, \npsychiatry succeeds in its goal of restoring patients to mental health when it \ntreats their psychiatric illnesses, where these illnesses are defined relative to \nstandard classifications such as the DSM-5.\nThis definition is often endorsed implicitly rather than explicitly. For ex-\nample, the current efforts to create parity between mental and physical \nhealth typically aim at improving access to treatment, while the campaigns \npromoting “mental health awareness” often mean little more than removing \nthe stigma around mental illness and starting conversations about its causes \nsuch as stress.4\nUnderlying the intuitions that mental health is largely about tackling mental \nillness is an explicit philosophical position; it exists thanks to Christopher \nBoorse’s writings from 1970s onwards. Boorse is well known for his so-called \nbiostatistical theory, which identifies health with normal species functioning. \nOne statement of this view is as follows:\nAn organism is healthy at any moment in proportion as it is not diseased; and a \ndisease is a type of internal state of the organism which:\n(i) Interferes with the performance of some natural function—i.e., some species-\ntypical contribution to survival and reproduction—characteristic of the organism’s \nage; and\n(ii) Is not simply in the nature of the species, i.e., is either atypical of the species or, \nif typical, mainly due to environmental causes. (Boorse, 1976, 62–3)\nThe “biostatistical” label picks out the simultaneous importance to this view \nof (a) evolution by natural selection as a way of identifying functions and \n(b) of typicality of a given condition relative to others in this population. 686 Sam Wren-Lewis and Anna Alexandrova"}, {"page": 4, "text": "Boorse’s main goal was and remains a purely descriptive, value-free con-\nception of health. It is a theoretical concept in physiology rather than in \nclinical medicine and as such it is sharply separate from normative ques-\ntions of how individuals ought to function and to which conditions of their \nbodies and minds medicine should attend (Boorse, 1977, 1997). For these \nlatter normative questions, Boorse proposes the notion of illness, that is, \nthose diseases that are concerning enough to warrant medical treatment \n(Boorse, 1975). Boorse emphasizes that it is a further question—a question \nfor ethics and political philosophy—whether a disease should be treated by \ndoctors, covered by health care, and be the subject of clinical research. He \nmight say the same for mental illness. Whether a given mental pathology \nshould be considered a mental illness is ultimately an evaluative question. \nFor instance, homosexuality, which at the time that Boorse was writing was \nbeing removed from DSM-III, may well be a disease on a value-free defin-\nition because it interferes with the function of reproduction, but it need not \nbe an illness. In contrast, feminism and opposition to the Vietnam War—\nalso controversies in the 1970s—have no basis for being considered psychi-\natric diseases, no matter how abnormal they might have seemed relative to \nprevailing social norms. Boorse positioned his theory against “normativism,” \nwhich attempted to ground health in some normative ideal and considered \nthe value-freedom of his view to be its major advantage. In a less-known \npaper, “What a Theory of Mental Health Should Be,” Boorse extended the \nbiostatistical theory to the case of mental health (Boorse, 1976). He argued \nthat the extension is not problematic in principle. So long as we are able \nto formulate mental as opposed to physical functions of the organism, the \natypical disfunction of one or more of these processes counts as a mental \ndisorder. What might those functions be? Boorse recognized that it is easier \nto identify functions that underwrite physical health—heart to pump, sweat \nto maintain body temperature, liver to filter blood, and so on—than it is to \npin down the mental functions that enable reproduction and survival. But \nhe ventured that it is possible and in fact rehearsed one such theory—psy-\nchoanalysis. He wrote:\nFormally speaking, psychoanalytic theory is the best account of mental health we \nhave. It closely follows the physiological model by positing three mental substruc-\ntures, the id, ego, and superego, and assigning fixed functions to each . . . . It would \nnot be difficult to construe psychoanalytic theory as a set of theses about biological \nfunctions of the mind. On this view the id might emerge as a reservoir of motivation, \nthe ego as an instrument of rational integration and cognitive competence, and the \nsuperego as a device of socialization. One could then give a straightforward argu-\nment that neurosis is disease by appealing to its disturbance of the integrative and \nmotivational functions of the ego and the id. (Boorse, 1976, 78).\nIt is a notable historical irony that, just as psychoanalysis and all its attendant \ncategories of trauma, repression, sublimation, and so on were getting purged  Mental Health Without Well-being 687"}, {"page": 5, "text": "from DSM-III,5 Boorse chose to ground his account of mental health, osten-\nsibly scientific and objective, in the theory that was quickly losing ground \nin the psychiatric consensus. Now in his view, there were strong reasons \nfor this choice. He was taking a stance against “normativists” who identified \nmental health with adjustment, normality, or well-being. The biostatistical \ntheory was for him the only viable option unless one was willing to grant \npsychiatry the power to judge people.\nFor us, the question is not whether Boorse’s particular account of mental \nhealth is plausible—40 years later, the standing of psychoanalysis in psych-\niatry is even weaker than it was in the 1970s. Rather, our question is whether, \ndespite Boorse’s conviction, there is any plausible formulation for a biostat-\nistical theory of mental health.\nIII. OBJECTIONS TO THE BIOSTATISTICAL THEORY\nBoorse’s formulation of the fundamental contrast between normativism on \nthe one hand and descriptivism (sometimes also known as naturalism) on \nthe other has defined philosophical debate ever since. This discussion has \npredominantly focused on the definition of physical health. There are still \ndefenders of naturalism (Hausman, 2011, 2015), but also of normativism \n(Cooper, 2002) and of a third option called hybridism (Wakefield, 1992). In \naddition to this, there are philosophers who reject the very possibility of ever \nsettling a single precise definition of what might be a messy and disordered \nconcept of disease (Worrall and Worrall, 2001; Ereshefsky, 2009). Those who \ncriticize the biostatistical theory do so on the grounds that it lacks a defens-\nible and value-free account of functions and of the right reference class \nagainst which to judge typicality. Critics have argued that it collapses under \nthe weight of counterexamples; that is, cases where malfunctioning does not \nintuitively count as disease or good functioning that does intuitively count as \nsuch (Worrall and Worrall, 2001; Kingma, 2007, 2009).\nLittle of this large literature paid any attention to Boorse’s attempt to account \nfor mental health. However, in our view the problems that philosophers \nhave uncovered in the process of arguing with Boorse about physical health \nare severe enough to make it unlikely that a value-free articulation of mental \nfunctions is possible. Certainly, no one to our knowledge has tried to put \nforward an alternative to Boorse’s original psychoanalytic version of mental \nhealth; the attempts to reduce mental disorders to disfunction at the neuro-\nlogical level are, while ongoing, controversial (Kendler et al., 2011; Cooper, \n2014b). While it is eminently plausible that some psychological capacities for \njudgment, valuation, and choice do make a clear contribution to survival and \nreproduction, the hard part is to articulate the overall set and to map this set \non the existing categories in psychiatric classifications. Which of the evolved \nmental functions should operate, at what level and in which environment 688 Sam Wren-Lewis and Anna Alexandrova"}, {"page": 6, "text": "for a person to count as mentally healthy? The question seems intractable as \nour contemporary environment differs so much from our ancestral one; it is \nhard to know how we would even begin to find out whether, say, anxiety—\nclearly an evolved response to dangerous situations—will emerge as a dis-\norder in this picture or not. This is one reason to reject Boorse’s naturalism.\nAnother reason is his implausible insistence on value-freedom. While for \nBoorse value-freedom was an essential guard against politicization of medi-\ncine in general and psychiatry in particular, his solution of distinguishing be-\ntween disease (value-free) and illness (value-laden) only delays the necessity \nof making value judgments to another stage, without eliminating this neces-\nsity. Today’s demands on the concept of mental health are very much action-\nguiding. Scientists who deploy definitions of mental health deploy them \nfor the most part not as Boorsean “theoretical concepts” relevant only to \ndispassionate and pure scientific research. Instead, their goal is deeply prac-\ntical—how and what to diagnose, how and what to manage, how and what \nto prevent. For these purposes, Boorse’s definition of mental health does not \nprovide the required normative guidance. This is unsurprising, given that \nBoorse does not think such guidance should be expected from the concept \nof health, so from his point of view this is not a weakness. Nevertheless, this \nlack does show the limited usefulness of his account.\nFurthermore, it is far from obvious that the value-freedom of his account \nprevents politicization of psychiatry. Despite Boorse’s valiant efforts to ar -\nticulate a value-free definition of disease, the value-ladenness of the DSM \ncategories is by now well documented.6 What counts as a “sufficient im-\npairment” or a “clinically significant” symptom are all locutions that conceal \nvalue judgments about the acceptable range of suffering and of deviation \nfrom norm. So if health is defined as absence of mental illness, then this def-\ninition is not all neutral, not at all naturalistic, because it inherits all the value \njudgments that inform definitions of depression, anxiety, attention deficit \nhyperactivity disorder, and so on.\nFinally, we should question the very desirability of even aiming at value-\nfreedom. Politicization of mental health is only threatening if any importation \nof values undermines the work this concept can do. Now it is far from clear \nthat, just because some normative judgments have led psychiatry astray, any \none of them would. Arguably, the problem was not that these judgments are \nnormative, but that they are oppressive, cruel, and stigmatizing.\nSo there are three reasons to be concerned with Boorse’s version of \nvalue-freedom: first, it makes the concept of mental health ineffective in \npractice, second, grounding health in absence of disease does not in fact \nsecure value-freedom if the existing definitions of disease are value-laden, \nand third, value-ladenness may not be as harmful as Boorse says it is. \nTogether with the fact that a plausible account of mental functions does \nnot exist, these create compelling reasons to look for a different account \nof mental health. Mental Health Without Well-being 689"}, {"page": 7, "text": "Now to arrive at such an account we need to consider our central objec-\ntion to the negative definition of health inherent in Boorse’s biostatistical \ntheory, an objection that other critics have left entirely untouched, at least to \nour knowledge. That is, that there is more to mental health than the absence \nof mental illness. This issue—whether mental health is negative or posi-\ntive—is entirely orthogonal to the previous controversy between naturalism \nand normativism. Boorse is a naturalist and a negativist, so to speak, but it \nis conceivable that naturalism can be paired up with a positive definition of \nhealth or that normativism be paired up with a negative one.\nWe have seen reasons to depart from naturalism about mental health, but \nwhy depart from a negative definition? Is health more than the “silence of \nthe organs?”7 Boorse himself rejected the calls for a positive definition—they \nwere prominent already in the 1970s—as entirely confused (Boorse, 1977, \n568–70). The relevant medical concept is the negative one and the positive \nconcept is mostly a rhetorical tool for enthusiasts of fitness, dieting, and \nother healthy living movements. Sure, prevention of disease is important, \nand these activities might be effective for that purpose, but nothing more \nthan the standard negative definition is needed for that. Ideas that go under \nthe label of positive health are only tools for reducing disease.\nThose who insist on adding a positive dimension to absence of disease \nwill have to deal with problems that to Boorse seemed unsurmountable. \nFirst, any positive characterization seems utopian because there is no natural \nlimit to it in the way that there is with absence of disease. One can cure an \nillness but it is hard to see how one can achieve full happiness, or full fit-\nness. Second, different positive dimensions of health can be incompatible \nwith each other, for example, being a sprinter and being a marathon runner. \nA positive definition of health would have to find a way of balancing them. \nFinally, he sees ethical problems with mandating any particular ideal of \npositive health:\nThe trouble with calling physical or mental or moral excellence health is that it tends \nto unite under one term a value-neutral notion, freedom from disease, with the most \ncontroversial of all prescriptions—the recipe for an ideal human being. (Boorse, \n1977, 572)\nBoorse’s critique of grand and ambitious positive definitions of health is \ncompelling; we will shortly add more reasons to be wary of them. Just as in \nthe argument for value-freedom Boorse unfairly saddled normativists with \nfailings of oppressive psychiatry, similarly here he is saddling the advocate \nof positive definition with an implausible version of it. If the positive defin-\nition is utopian or unattainable, it should indeed be rejected. Now must it be \nutopian and unattainable? Is there a version that is positive and yet realistic \nand attractive?\nThere is good reason to try to build one. The negative definition ties \nmental health to the immensely controversial categories of mental disorders 690 Sam Wren-Lewis and Anna Alexandrova"}, {"page": 8, "text": "of contemporary psychiatry and nothing else. We have already seen that \nvalue judgments are already part and parcel of the definition of health on the \n“absence of disease” model. If so, why not rethink them with positive value \njudgments? A positive definition of health can act as a check on the values \nthat ground the negative one, and it can explain why absence of disease \nis a good state to aim at. This promise obviously depends on the avail-\nability of a defensible positive conception; in many ways, we have already \njumped ahead of ourselves. What are these demanding positive conceptions \nof which Boorse is so critical, and what exactly is wrong with them?\nIV. THE DEMANDING POSITIVE DEFINITIONS\nPerhaps the best-known definition of mental health is articulated by the \nWorld Health Organization:\nMental health is defined as a state of well-being in which every individual realizes \nhis or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work pro-\nductively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community. \n(World Health Organization, 2004)\nThis statement harks back to WHO’s definition of health, which appeared \nin its inaugural 1948 Constitution: “Health is a state of complete physical, \nmental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or in-\nfirmity.” Mental health according to WHO is also a positive state: it is not \nenough to be free of depression, anxiety, or schizophrenia, or any other \ndiagnosable psychiatric condition; one also needs to be well enough to \nthrive and flourish in one’s community.\nThis definition is remarkable in more than one way. First of all, it is incred-\nibly demanding: it describes a life in which individuals realize their full po-\ntential, as well as work productively and contribute to their community. Not \nmany people meet such high standards. It is not clear exactly how high of a \nstandard the definition endorses, but read literally, the standard is very high. \nA lot of seemingly well-functioning people would plausibly fail this test. It is \npossible that many of us are indeed mentally unhealthy, but it is also possible \nthat this definition sets the bar too high. Second, it is an explicitly objective \ndefinition in that it demands that individuals actually meet these standards, \nnot just think they do. Finally, it demands functioning in harmony with dis-\ntinctly modern norms—these norms set what counts as normal stress, pro-\nductive work, and contribution to society. The ethos of this definition is that \none should not be a burden to one’s community: that is, when bad things \nhappen to persons, they should be able to bounce back, and in particular, \nthey should be able to hold a job and do their bit. Depending on how the \nexpression “normal stresses of life” is cashed out, the definition can be in-\nterpreted as demanding that people do or do not expect to be rescued from \nunemployment or debilitating disease; in this sense, the definition implicitly  Mental Health Without Well-being 691"}, {"page": 9, "text": "refers to the modern welfare state. This is unsurprising: the 1948 definition of \nhealth was born just after World War II when the public health services were \nbeing institutionalized at the level of nation states and integrated into gov-\nernance, while the more recent definition of mental health was put forward \nwith heavy participation of economists from the World Bank.8\nThe WHO definition is not unique in being demanding. In 1958, following \na wide-ranging review of literature on mental health and illness, British-\nAustrian sociologist Marie Jahoda articulated an influential and perhaps an \neven more demanding ideal, encompassing six criteria:\n 1. Self-acceptance and self-confidence\n 2. Self-actualization\n 3. Integration of different psychological functions\n 4. Autonomy\n 5. Accurate perception of reality\n 6. Environmental mastery (Jahoda, 1958)\nUnlike WHO, Jahoda does not mention work and community contribution, \nbut she adds the truth and accuracy requirement. Her goals are distinctly hu-\nmanistic. She wishes to move beyond the emphasis on “adjustment” as the \nkey aspect of mental health in the tradition of Karl Menninger (Menninger, \n1930). But in rejecting this identification of mental health with social accept-\nability, she introduces an individualistic ideal based on the goals of excel-\nlence, competence, and autonomy.\nToday, positive definitions of mental health have taken a distinct turn \ninspired by positive psychology. They have grounded mental health in \nwell-being, flourishing, and happiness. Scientists in this tradition refer to \n“flourishing,” “mental wealth of nations,” and a number of other positive \nconcepts that describe individuals’ psychological resources.9 These defin-\nitions are weaker in some sense but stronger in another. They are weaker \nin that the well-being in question is subjective rather than objective, but \nstronger in articulating specific positive emotions such as happiness, life sat-\nisfaction, or sense of flourishing.\nWhat might be wrong with this?\nV. AGAINST DEMANDING DEFINITIONS\nThe proposals we mentioned above differ from each other in subtle ways \nand should ideally be examined individually. Now for present purposes, \nit is sufficient to identify a few concerns. Not all undermine each of the \ndemanding options to the same extent; together, they nicely illustrate the \nproblem.\nThe first problem is medicalization of unhappiness, idleness, dependence, \nand so on. Setting a given level of a positive good as a condition of mental \nhealth turns this good into a medical category when it was not previously 692 Sam Wren-Lewis and Anna Alexandrova"}, {"page": 10, "text": "so. Medicalization has a complex history where progress and humanism are \nintertwined with use of medicine for control and oppression (Conrad, 2007). \nTreating substance addiction as a medical problem rather than a moral failing \nis a positive illustration, but it is far less clear whether the failure of a child \nto conform to the modern classroom is an illness. The latter worries motivate \ncritics of the modern scale of medicalization who point out that extending \nthe domain of psychiatry actually undermines its epistemic and moral legit-\nimacy (Charland, 2013).\nIt is not clear that any of the advocates of the demanding positive defin-\nitions are aware of these dangers. Take public health—clearly an important \nbusiness of local and national governments. Political theorists of all stripes \nagree that the pursuit of this business carries dangers of oppression, such \nas when a government-backed ideal, in this case an ideal of mental health, \nis imposed on individuals in violation of their autonomy and self-determin-\nation. In the liberal tradition, such an imposition is a violation of the much-\nvalued condition of neutrality, but in other intellectual traditions, such as the \ncritical theory, medicalization is one of the instruments of maintenance and \nreproduction of an existing social order.\nIf it were possible to formulate a nonoppressive ideal of mental health \n(which we believe is possible), the intent to identify it with well-being or \nthe good life raises difficult epistemic and conceptual issues regarding which \nnotion of well-being to use and which elements to incorporate into “overall \nwell-being.” Philosophers and social scientists typically treat well-being as \nan inclusive good, encompassing not just happiness, but also goods such as \nfriendship, love, achievement, sense of purpose, and so on. How to weigh \nthese goods in relation to each other is surely a deeply personal matter, \nand it is not clear whether a defensible recipe exists at the population level \n(Hausman, 2015; Alexandrova, 2017). It is precisely this problem—fitting all \nthat well-being encompasses in one valid and practical measurement pro-\ncedure—that motivates recent criticisms of well-being interventions in public \nhealth, such as the one articulated by England’s Chief Medical Officer:\nAfter reviewing the evidence I conclude that well-being does not have a sufficiently \nrobust evidence base commensurate with the level of attention and funding it cur -\nrently receives in public mental health at national and local government level. Well-\nbeing, as a field within mental health, has not evidenced an acceptable definition \nor set of metrics. It is unclear how concepts and measures that do exist relate to \npopulations with mental illness. (Davies, 2014, 15)\nThis harsh verdict is not uncontested (Huppert and Ruggieri, 2018) and the \nmeasurement of well-being remains a lively project in the social and medical \nsciences. However, whether measures of mental health should be identical \nto measures of well-being is and should be controversial.\nWhere does this leave us? The negative conception is not positive enough, \nwhile the existing positive ones are too positive, so to speak. Is there a  Mental Health Without Well-being 693"}, {"page": 11, "text": "happy medium? We submit there is, namely, a relatively value-neutral def-\ninition of mental health that avoids the problems associated with defining \nmental health in terms of well-being. To see where this more ecumenical \nconception lies, it is useful to analyze how it differs from common defin-\nitions of mental health. For instance, the following definition by the Public \nHealth Agency of Canada is a fairly typical instance of how mental health is \nconceptualized by health practitioners and within public policy:\nThe capacities of each and all of us to feel, think, and act in ways that enhance our \nability to enjoy life and deal with the challenges we face. It is a positive sense of \nemotional and spiritual well-being that respects the importance of culture, equity, \nsocial justice, interconnections, and personal dignity.10\nHow does our definition of mental health differ from this kind of concep-\ntion? We wish the authors had stopped after the promising first sentence and \nskipped the overly grand second sentence altogether. What if we identified \nmental health not with well-being, but rather with those psychological cap-\nacities that, if developed and maintained, enable individuals to pursue any \nconception of the good life or well-being, whatever conception of it they \nadopt? In the following section, we flesh out the idea that mental health is a \nprecondition of well-being, without being identical to well-being.\nVI. MENTAL HEALTH AS A PSYCHOLOGICAL PRIMARY GOOD\nLet us begin with that first sentence from the Public Health Agency of Canada \ndefinition, which takes mental health to consist in “the capacities of each and \nall of us to feel, think, and act in ways that enhance our ability to enjoy life \nand deal with the challenges we face.” There are four notable features of \nthis one-sentence definition, which we will briefly consider in turn before \nformulating our more general definition of mental health.\nFirst, mental health concerns our capacities to feel, think, and act in cer -\ntain ways that enhance our ability to attain certain states of affairs. It is not \ndefined by how we actually feel, think, and act or by what we actually attain. \nAlready these qualifications limit the scope of mental health in a liberal dir -\nection. This has much in common with the “capabilities approach” toward \nhuman development and justice (Nussbaum, 2000; Sen, 1999). According to \nthe capability approach, the good life is not about having a set of goods, \nbut rather about having a set of valuable capabilities. Valuable capabilities \ninclude freedoms to undertake valuable activities (e.g., holding a decent \njob, being able to engage in politics, being able to spend time in unspoilt \nnature) or freedoms to enjoy certain states of being (e.g., being healthy, \nbeing respected for one’s religious affiliation or sexual orientation, being \nable to live in a loving family and a supportive social network) (Robeyns, \n2017). The advantage of focusing on capabilities—the abilities, skills, and 694 Sam Wren-Lewis and Anna Alexandrova"}, {"page": 12, "text": "opportunities—rather than actual states of doing and being is that people \nremain free to decide whether, and how best, to use them. Out of all capabil-\nities our definition of mental health will be grounded in the psychological \nones to feel and to think and we shall reserve for them the term “capacities.”\nThis focus on human capacities also coheres with George Graham’s def-\ninition of mental disorder (Graham, 2013). Graham defines mental dis-\norder as the inability to develop and exercise psychological capacities for \n“flourishing,” which he further defines as the capacities we are bound to \nneed, no matter what life we decide to pursue. In defining mental disorder \nin this way, Graham is drawing explicitly on John Rawls’ notion of primary \ngoods—all-purpose goods that people need, whatever their plans. According \nto Rawls, liberal states should provide citizens with the necessary means to \npursue their own conceptions of the good. As long as the pursuit of one’s \nown conception of the good does not result in harm to others, it is not the \nbusiness of the state to deem whether or not one’s own conception of the \ngood is worthwhile. Although Rawls was concerned with the material and \nsocial basis for primary goods, his theory can be extended to the psycho-\nlogical conditions required for people to pursue their own conceptions of \nthe good life. We believe this way of defining mental health is useful and \navoids the problems associated with definitions that ground mental health in \nthe notion of well-being.\nThe second notable feature of the above one-sentence definition of mental \nhealth is that it is minimal. Instead of a long list of capacities, it consists in \ntwo: namely, the ability to enjoy life and the ability to deal with challenges \nwe face. These capacities are broad and can be specified in a number of \nways. For reasons of liberal neutrality, we consider this to be a virtue of a \ndefinition of mental health, rather than a vice. Recall that the Public Health \nAgency of Canada definition goes on to specify how these capacities are \nrealized, stating that mental health is “a positive sense of emotional and \nspiritual well-being that respects the importance of culture, equity, social \njustice, interconnections, and personal dignity.” We can see how outlining \nthe breadth of mental health in this way can be useful—showing how it may \nbe impacted by a wide range of conditions, such as culture, equity, social \njustice, interconnections, and personal dignity. Although this may be true for \nsome individuals, it may not be the case for others. The conditions that are \nactually required for people to enjoy life and deal with challenges they face \nis largely an empirical question and is partly determined by differences in \npersonality, age, context, and culture.\nThird, the above definition concerns capacities to feel, think, and act in \ncertain ways. This emphasis on psychological capacities—feeling, thinking, \nand acting—distinguishes it from definitions of physical health. Definitions \nof physical health (positively construed) are concerned with the physio-\nlogical capacities that enhance our ability to enjoy life and deal with the \nchallenges we face. This does not mean to say there are not significant areas  Mental Health Without Well-being 695"}, {"page": 13, "text": "of crossover between the two, for example, diet, exercise, social connection. \nHowever, we believe the above distinction accounts for the main differences \nbetween physical and mental health treatment.\nFourth, it is worth noting the two broad capacities that mental health con-\nsists in according to the above definition: (a) to enjoy life and (b) to deal \nwith the challenges we face. These broad capacities get to the heart of what it \nmeans to be mentally healthy. However, we believe they can be even more \nbroadly construed to qualify as a psychological primary good. First, we can \nre-construe the ability to enjoy life as the ability to value life—to see life as \nvaluable or worth living. Not everyone needs to enjoy life to pursue their \nown conception of the good life. However, the ability to value life is a neces-\nsary precondition for well-being. We can reconstrue the second capacity in a \nsimilar way. The ability to deal with the challenges we face is an important \ncomponent of the wider ability to engage in life—to pursue the things in life \nthat seem valuable or worthwhile, despite difficulties, challenges, setbacks, \nfailures, losses, and so on.\nAlthough these capacities come in degrees, they nonetheless can fall \nabove or below certain thresholds. For instance, one symptom of depres-\nsion is that patients are unable to see value in themselves, others, or their \nenvironment. Similarly, patients with general anxiety disorder, due to exces-\nsive worry and anticipation of disaster, may be unable to cope with various \ndemands and threats concerning the things they care about. In both cases, \npatients can be viewed as slipping below a certain threshold of being able \nto value or engage in life.\nOn the basis of these four points, we can offer the following one-sentence \ndefinition of mental health as, “the capacities of each and all of us to feel, \nthink, and act in ways that enable us to value and engage in life.” In the next \nsection, we outline what we take these psychological capacities for valuing \nand engagement to consist. Note that we only offer this outline as a way of \nclarifying the scope of this relatively neutral definition of mental health. It is \na starting point for a full, empirically informed account, which is beyond the \nscope of this article.\nVII. TOWARD A BROAD DEFINITION OF MENTAL HEALTH\nWe maintain that mental health can be defined as “the capacities of each and \nall of us to feel, think, and act in ways that enable us to value and engage in \nlife.” In this section, we expand on what the two main features of this defin-\nition—valuing life and engaging in life—consist.\nConsider valuing life, first. We take this to consist in capacities to care \nabout certain states of affairs—features of ourselves, others, and our environ-\nment. When one values something, one is positively disposed toward it (in \na psychological sense) in various ways (Tiberius, 2018). For example, when 696 Sam Wren-Lewis and Anna Alexandrova"}, {"page": 14, "text": "one loves someone, one may feel a sense of warmth and connection around \nthem, a mild form of separation distress when they leave, be motivated to \ncare for them and look out for their well-being, and so on. This is different to \nmerely seeing something as good or valuable in some way. Valuing, in add-\nition, involves being disposed or committed to seeing something as valuable. \nThis may not always take the form of an explicit value judgment toward that \nthing (i.e., “I value X” or “I believe X is worthwhile”) but nonetheless influ-\nences how one consistently feels, thinks, and acts in relation to it over time.11\nOur capacities to value certain states of affairs may seem relatively straight-\nforward or foundational, but they still need to be developed, and may re-\nmain fragile throughout our lives. Psychopathy, for instance, can be viewed \npartly as an inability to develop certain valuing capacities, in particular, the \nability to value the well-being of others. Alternatively, individuals may lose \ntheir valuing capacities, as can be the case with depression, or during ex-\ntreme cases of grief. To be able to appreciate life is foundational to our sense \nof agency, but it is far from straightforward. Valuing certain states of affairs—\nfeatures of ourselves, others, and our environment—is a complex endeavor, \nwhich may, among other things, require the presence of basic goods, such \nas pleasure, loving relationships, moral worth, and good effects, and the ab-\nsence of their opposites (Smuts, 2017).\nLet us now turn to the second part of our proposed definition of mental \nhealth, namely, engaging in life. This includes the ability to “deal with chal-\nlenges we face,” as emphasized in the Public Health Agency of Canada def-\ninition above. Again, this is just a sketch, but we take engaging in life to at \nleast partly consist in the capacities that make up psychological flexibility.12 \nPsychological flexibility is “the ability to change or persist in behavior when \ndoing so serves valued ends” (Hayes et al., 2011). In the pursuit of valued \nends, we often come across difficulties, challenges, setbacks, failures, and \nlosses. In response, being psychologically flexible enables us to shift our \nperspective, successfully adapt, and learn from our situation. This may result \nin either changing or persisting behavior, depending on what is learned. For \ninstance, the practice of mindfulness often involves subjects simply paying \nattention to their sensations, thoughts, and feelings—neither ignoring them \nnor seeing them as the full picture. This can help subjects act on the infor -\nmation provided by those sensations without engaging in habitual patterns \nof meaning and behavior.13\nAs with our capacities to value life, our capacities for engaging in life also \nneed to be developed, and may remain fragile in the response to various \ndifficulties, setbacks, and adversities. Mental disorders such as depression \nand general anxiety disorders often involve individuals “getting stuck” in cer -\ntain ways of thinking, feeling, and acting. We may often be able to pursue \nour values through the formation of appropriate goals and plans. However, \nwhen things inevitably do not go to plan, we may be more or less able \nto treat our situation in a psychologically flexible manner. Psychological  Mental Health Without Well-being 697"}, {"page": 15, "text": "flexibility involves being able to see such situations as providing us with \nworthwhile—if not predominantly negative—information. We may use this \ninformation to form new goals and plans, and different sets of skills, habits, \nand behaviors. These abilities to understand and act within any given situ-\nation, or within any area of life, are foundational to a person’s mental health.\nIn summary, our definition of mental health builds on existing positive \ndefinitions of mental health, while stripping them down to their foundations. \nWe focus on people’s basic abilities to form values and pursue them in the \nface of life’s difficulties and challenges. In short, we suggest that mental \nhealth consists in people’s basic psychological capacities to value and en-\ngage in life. These capacities are positive psychological features, not mere \nabsence of mental illness, but they are not sufficient for well-being. The \ndefinition thus offers more than the negative one and less than the utopian \nones.\nVIII. OBJECTIONS AND REPLIES\nIn this section, we consider some objections. According to our definition, \nmental health concerns the capacities of each and all of us to feel, think, and \nact in ways that enable us to value and engage in life. One might object that \nboth of these two main features of the definition—valuing life and engaging \nin life—are problematic notions.\nConsider, first, the notion of valuing life. One might object that our defin-\nition of valuing life does not consist in capacities for valuing things that are \nactually valuable. For example, according to our definition, someone might \nqualify as being mentally healthy, even if they value things that do not make \nthem better off, such as fame and fortune. This is problematic insofar as \nmental health is typically viewed as something of value, either in an intrinsic \nor instrumental sense (Raibley, 2013). Why should we care about people’s \nmental health if it consists in people valuing things that do not contribute \ntoward their well-being?\nIn response, we believe that we should embrace the potential for men-\ntally healthy individuals to develop values and conceptions of the good life \nthat may not in fact be good for them. Thus, according to our definition, \nmental health is a necessary but not sufficient precondition for well-being. \nWell-being requires not merely the ability to value certain states of affairs, \nbut rather the ability to value states of affairs that are good for us. Instead of \nviewing this as a weakness of our definition, we take it to be a strength. In \ncontrast to the notion of well-being that is defined relative to some substan-\ntive good such as pleasure, success, or flourishing, the concept of mental \nhealth makes reference only to valuing and engagement; these capacities \nare neutral with respect to the precise conception of well-being that an indi-\nvidual may adopt. We hope, or rather it is an empirical bet we are making, 698 Sam Wren-Lewis and Anna Alexandrova"}, {"page": 16, "text": "that whether one is a hedonist, an Aristotelian, or a desire theorist, certain \ncapacities are fundamental. That these capacities are as we outlined above, \nis an empirical matter we want science or medicine to answer.14 This is not \nto say that our definition is purely descriptive. What it takes to value and to \nengage may well require value judgments (for instance, about what counts \nas a normal setback vs. an insurmountable obstacle that people should not \nbe expected to overcome), but these judgments are less contentious than \njudgments about the nature of well-being.\nThus, our definition of mental health steers clear of normative judgments \nabout what is good for us and how we ought to live. Mental health consists \nin being able to value certain features of ourselves, others, and our envir -\nonment, rather than certain features we should value according to any par -\nticular prudential, moral, or religious theory.\nThe second objection relates to the notion of engaging in life. The ability \nof individuals to effectively pursue the things they value requires a range of \nattentional, emotional, and cognitive capacities (Mele, 1997; Holton, 2009; \nBratman, 2018). In contrast, our definition of mental health only consists in \nthe broad capacities that make up psychological flexibility—the ability to \nchange or persist in behavior when doing so serves valued ends. One might \nobject that this definition is relatively uninformative.\nIn response, although it is tempting to expand this list of capacities to \ninclude other psychological capacities (in particular, those related to the for -\nmation and maintenance of social relationships), we want to resist this move. \nA more expansive list may include the kinds of psychological capacities out-\nlined in Jahoda’s definition of mental health discussed above—things such as \nself-acceptance and self-confidence, self-actualization, autonomy, and envir -\nonmental mastery (Jahoda, 1958). However, we have argued that these more \ndemanding definitions of mental health are problematic in various ways. In \norder to remain as value-neutral as possible, our definition of mental health \nconsists in broad psychological capacities which can then be further spe-\ncified, on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with a particular individual’s \nvalues, and other, more general, factors such as their personality, age, con-\ntext, and culture.\nThe result is a definition of mental health that views mental health as a ne-\ncessary (but not sufficient) precondition for well-being. Moreover, it leaves \nconsiderable room for empirical work to flesh out what mental health con-\nsists in for different cultures, groups, personalities, ages, and so on, and clin-\nical work to determine the specific capacities that affect the mental health \nof any given individual. Being able to value and engage with life is likely to \nconsist in a complex range of attentional, emotional, and cognitive capacities \nthat will vary considerably by context. Nonetheless, our definition of mental \nhealth provides a rough outline of the broad kinds of psychological capaci-\nties that matter and why. Mental Health Without Well-being 699"}, {"page": 17, "text": "IX. LOOKING AHEAD\nWe have argued that there exists a happy medium between the insufficiently \nand the overly demanding definitions of mental health. Our definition has \nthe following features:\n 1. It is positive rather than negative because in addition to the absence of \ndisease, we specify a further requirement.\n 2. It is grounded in well-being without identifying mental health with \nwell-being.\n 3. It is politically legitimate or at least has a better chance of being so than \nthe more demanding definitions.\nBy way of conclusion, we wish to raise two issues we have not discussed in \nthis article but that may well be affected by our proposal. First is the issue of \nmeasurement. It is a live controversy which scales, questionnaires, and indi-\ncators best capture mental health. One popular scale for measuring “mental \nwell-being” is the Warwick and Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale, which \nasks people to judge the extent to which they feel optimistic, effective, \nuseful, relaxed, able to get along with other people, and to make up their \nmind about things (Stewart-Brown and Janmohamed, 2008). Although it has \nthe word “well-being” in it, in fact it measures people’s own sense of their \npersonal effectiveness for going through with basics of life. There is a dif-\nference between this sense of personal effectiveness on the one hand and \nsubjective well-being on the other. Intuitively, the latter refers to our emo-\ntional well-being, our happiness, our fullness of heart, joy, and contentment. \nFeeling happy takes more than just patting yourself on the back for being \neffective. Quite possibly, this scale captures our definition reasonably well, \nbut this is ultimately a question for a proper psychometric investigation.15\nThe second issue is which interventions support mental health on our def-\ninition. This is of course an empirical question. However, it seems likely that \nmental health as a precondition of well-being would need more than medi-\ncation and talk therapy. The development and the maintenance of the rele-\nvant psychological skills call for interventions at social rather than individual \nlevels, anticipating structural obstacles to exercise of agency such as gender \nnorms, racial and class discrimination, and generally aim at empowerment, \nrather than only treatment and prevention.\nNOTES\n 1.
