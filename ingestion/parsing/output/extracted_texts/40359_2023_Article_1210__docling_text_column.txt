## Abstract

In this editorial to the special collection 'Mental Health, Discourse and Stigma' we outline the concepts of mental, health, discourse and stigma as they are examined through sociolinguistic lenses. We examine the sociolinguistic approach to mental health and stigma and discuss the different theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches that have been applied in such contexts. Sociolinguistics views mental health and stigma as discursively constructed and constituted, i.e. they are both manifest, negotiated, reinforced or contested in the language that people use. We highlight existing gaps in sociolinguistic research and outline how it could enrich research in psychology and psychiatry and contribute to professional practice. Specifically, sociolinguistics provides well-established methodological tools to research the 'voices' of people with a history of mental ill health, their family, carers and mental health professionals in both online and off-line contexts. This is vital to develop targeted interventions and to contribute to de-stigmatization of mental health. To conclude, we highlight the importance of transdisciplinary research that brings together expertise in psychology, psychiatry and sociolinguistics.

## Introduction

This  special  collection  brings  together  the  three  broad themes of mental health, discourse and stigma as they are examined  through  sociolinguistic  lenses.  We  first  present what we mean by mental health, discourse and stigma and  discuss  the  interrelationships  between  these  concepts. We then offer a brief overview of existing sociolinguistic research on mental health and stigma and identify continuing areas of under-research that we hope this special collection will contribute to. Finally, we ask the questions of 'why?' and 'so what?' in relation to sociolinguistic research on mental health and stigma and outline some ways in which this growing area of research could meaningfully  contribute  to  broader  professional  practice  in psychology and psychiatry.

## Defining mental health, mental health stigma and discourse

A  range  of  theoretical  frameworks  and  methodological approaches have been used to investigate mental health and stigma across different  disciplines,  including  sociolinguistics.  Historically,  the  study  of  mental  health  has been  dominated  by  psychology  and  psychiatry  which has  led  to  a  'psychiatrization'  [1]  of  mental  health  and illness,  approaching  the  matter  from  a  clinical  perspective. In this special collection, we adopt the World Health Organization's (WHO) encompassing definition of mental  health  as  'a  state  of  mental  well-being  that  enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities,  learn  well  and  work  well,  and  contribute  to  their community'  [2]. The WHO's  description  of mental health acknowledges that 'mental health is broader than the lack of a mental disorder' , and encompasses mental disorders,  psychosocial  disabilities,  and  'other  mental states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning, or risk of self-harm' [2]. This definition also

emphasizes  the  close  interrelationship  between  mental health and social aspects of life.

Closely intertwined with the concept of mental health is  the  concept  of  stigma  that  has  also  been  widely researched  in  psychology,  psychiatry,  as  well  as  sociology. In his seminal essay, sociologist Erving Goffman [3] defines stigma as 'an attribute that is deeply discrediting' . Stigmatized individuals are often perceived as being different and 'lesser' than 'the normals' [3]. Contemporary definitions  of  mental  health  stigma  largely  follow  Goffman's  work,  highlighting  its  discrediting  attributes  and the negative attitudes attached to it [4, 5]. These attitudes also  extend  to  people  in  the  immediate  surroundings, such as family [6], and even mental health professionals [7,  8].  This  is  known  as  associative  or  courtesy  stigma, i.e.  being  stigmatized  because  of  a  relationship  to  an individual  experiencing  a  mental  health  problem  [9]. Long describes  associative  stigma  experienced  by  mental  health  professionals  who  are  stigmatized  because  of being  'attached  to  their  patients  and  […]  positioned  as a  less  prestigious  branch  of  a  broader  medical  profession' [7]. Shipman and Zayts discuss an extreme case of such associative stigma where a psychiatrist practising in Hong Kong is stigmatized by his own family for working with mentally ill people and for fear of 'transmission' of a mental illness [8].

Psychological  research  on  mental  health  stigma  has burgeoned since Goffman's study. Focusing on the 'micro-level social interactions' , this research has examined  the  causes  of  stigma,  its  cognitive  dimensions,  the consequences and the coping responses [10, 11].  Fewer sociological  studies  existed  [10],  but  following  a  muchcited  publication  by  Link  and  Phelan  [12],  sociological research  has  proliferated.  Link  and  Phelan  re-defined stigma,  surmising  it  to  four  processes:  labelling  differences,  stereotyping  differences,  separating  the  stigmatized from 'us' , and discriminating against the stigmatized [12]. By highlighting the processes of discrimination and separation of the stigmatized from 'us' , Link and Phelan essentially  expanded  the  definition  of  stigma  to  the macro-level  social  processes,  such  as  social  inequality, discrimination based on one's mental health status, and discriminating  societal  ideologies.  These  macro-social forms  of  stigma  are  known  as  structural  stigma  [11]. Workplace  settings  are  one  example  when  employers are hesitant to hire or promote people with a history of mental  health  problems,  although  these  discriminatory attitudes  are  typically  subtle  and  indirect.  Sociological research  has  largely  focused  on  how  different  types  of stigma contribute to inequalities and impact social relationships between different groups [10].

Sociolinguistics  studies  the  interrelationship  between language  and  society  [13]  of  which  discourse  is  a  central sociolinguistic concept. It is equally as nebulous and multifaceted as the concepts of mental health and stigma. Discourse may refer to:

- -A stretch of language above a clause or a sentence level [14].
-  Language used by speakers to covey and negotiate certain meanings and achieve particular purposes [15].
-  Language used to represent various social practices, social actors and ideologies [16, 17].

Relating  these  different  interpretations  of  discourse  to mental health contexts, in its micro-analytic understanding  discourse  may  refer,  for  example,  to  negative  stereotypical  attributes,  such  as  'mad' ,  'crazy' ,  and  'insane' . Culturally, there exist striking differences in how mental health  disorders  are  described,  although  negative  connotations  typically  prevail.  For  example,  the  term 精神 分裂症 in  Chinese (jīng-shén-fēn liè zhèn ɡ ,  schizophrenia)  has  a  literal  translation  of  'the  split-mind  disease' . This term is heavily stigmatizing. Substantial efforts have been made by mental health professionals in Hong Kong to  introduce  less  stigmatizing  terms,  such  as 思覺失調 (sī jué shī tiáo, psychosis) that translates as 'thought and perceptual dysregulation' [18].

In relation to discourse as 'language-in-use' , the following example from an interview with a psychiatrist illustrates  how  the  diagnosis  of  a  'schizophrenic  patient'  is used to account for the tragic event of mass killing that has  marked,  in  this  psychiatrist's  words,  'a  milestone' in  the  development  of  psychiatric  services  in  Hong Kong.  It  is  an  objectivized,  'clinical'  account  of  a  mental  health disorder and its impact on one's behaviour. It also highlights a wider societal impact in response to the recounted incident.

## Example 1 Psypsychiatrist; Iinterviewer .

6.  Psy: Yes. The most well known in Hong Kong is this 1982 tragedy […] Schizophrenic patient, young man killed his mother and sister at home [.] and then went down with two knives and entered a kindergarten and killed four more.

## 11.  I: Children?

12.  Psy: Four kids and wounded forty something. […] This incident created, it may be regarded as a milestone for the development of the service, because after this incident all the society turned attention to mental health, mental patients.

The last approach to discourse foregrounds how mental health is constructed through social practices. Mental health  and  mental  health  stigma  are  'socially  and  discursively  constituted'  [19]  with  a  bidirectional  relationship  between  discourse  and  social  practices.  Crudely speaking, discourse is the 'mirror' through which social practices  and  ideologies  become  evident.  For  example, different linguistic choices, such as the use of derogative, direct or figurative language to talk about mental health, reflect the dominant societal practice and ideologies. In the reverse, ways of communicating about mental health impact  social  practices  and  ideologies.  One  example could  be  media  portrayals  of  mental  health  as  both  a reflection  of  prevalent  societal  ideologies  and  ways  to impact  them.  These  different  conceptualizations  of  discourse have been employed in sociolinguistic studies of mental health and mental health stigma.

## Sociolinguistic research on mental health and mental health stigma

In this special collection, we use the term sociolinguistics broadly  to  include  linguistic  approaches  and  methodologies as diverse as corpus linguistics, different types of discourse  analysis  (e.g.  thematic  and  critical),  conversation analysis, narrative inquiry, to name just a few. While these approaches conceptualise discourse differently, most sociolinguistic studies on mental health and mental health stigma take a social constructivist view, viewing language as a means of constructing social reality. Sociolinguistic  studies  include  quantitative,  qualitative  and mixed methods studies. They examine diverse discourse data,  from  interactions  in  clinical  contexts,  to  online interactions between members of mental health support groups,  to  large  media  corpora.  Each  of  these  different types  of  data  provides  insights  into  different  aspects  of mental health and has both strengths and limitations.

Arguably, one of the most potent sociolinguistic approaches  to  mental  health  research  to  date  has  been corpus  linguistics  [19-23].  Corpus  linguistics  refers  to methods  that  use  computerized  tools  (e.g.  Wordsmith, Sketch Engine) to analyse large collections of data (corpora). While the corpus size could be substantial, the use of  tools  allows  consistent  and  fairly  easy  identification of  patterns  in  the  data  [1].  Another  common  sociolinguistic approach is critical discourse analysis (CDA) [24, 25]. For example, Price uses corpus linguistics and CDA to interrogate news reports on mental health in the UK from  1984  to  2014  [26].  Substantial  corpus  data  delve into media's portrayals of mental health, and how mental health stigma is created and perpetuated by media.

Notably,  sociolinguistic  research  often  includes  the 'voices' of under-represented, vulnerable or underresearched demographic groups. For example, Galinsky's and colleagues' research focuses on discourses surrounding male depression and suicide [27-29]. Societal ideologies around men as strong and powerful often stop men from  seeking  help  and  opening  up  about  their  mental health  struggles.  Sociolinguistic  research  has  much  to contribute to elucidating these dominant ideologies and support  organizations targeting men's mental  health (e.g.  Mind  UK  or  Manup).  It  could  also  contribute  to understanding  groups  'associated'  with  people  with  a history  of  mental  ill  health.  For  example,  Ziółkowskaa and  Galasiński,  examine  the  narratives  of  children  of fathers who died by suicide and how they deal with both bereavement  of  their  deceased  parent  and  the  stigma attached to death by suicide [29].

These  are  just  a  few  examples  of  previous  and  ongoing sociolinguistic research,  and  in  this special  collection  we  welcome  contributions  that  apply  different theoretical  frameworks  and  methodological  approaches in sociolinguistics.

## The 'why?' and the 'so what?' of sociolinguistic research on mental health and mental health stigma

This brief overview of sociolinguistic research points to some of the possible applications of research to professional  practice.  Sociolinguistic  research  focuses  on  discourses of mental health. These discourses are powerful, they are the means to talk about mental health, the locale where  mental  health  issues  are  manifest,  the  means  to seek and offer help, and the ways to offer education and develop interventions. They are also the means to challenge and contest negative ideologies. De-stigmatisation of  mental  health  can  be  achieved  through  structural changes  (e.g.  offering  equal  employment  opportunities) but  most,  if  not  all,  social  activities  and  practices  are mediated through language. Therefore, sociolinguistic  research  continues  to  make  a  strong  contribution  to mental health de-stigmatization, research and practice.

There  is  an  increasing  emphasis  in  psychology  and psychiatry on participatory research, including with vulnerable  demographic  groups  [30].  As  this  editorial emphasizes, a strength of current sociolinguistic research is  that  it  investigates  the  'voices'  of  different  groups  of people affected by mental ill health. Established sociolinguistic approaches (e.g. narrative inquiry, rhetorical discourse analysis) provide tools to examine different types of  accounts  for  the  social  actions  that  people  perform, why  and  when  people  give  accounts,  and  the  language that they use when they do it. Investigating these data is important to develop targeted interventions for different groups of people affected by mental ill health.

Sociolinguistic research also 'weaves together' the micro-interactions  with  other  contexts,  the  meso  (e.g. institutional) and the macro (societal), bringing personal and the social aspects of mental health together to provide a more holistic picture.

Our brief overview has identified research gaps. There remains  a  paucity  of  empirical  sociolinguistic  research that uses real-life interactional data in face-to-face communicative  encounters  in  mental  health  contexts, for  example,  in  counselling  or  psychotherapy  encounters. This may be partly due to ethical considerations of access and the use of sensitive data (for exceptions, see, for  example,  Lavie  and  Nakash)  [31].  Examining  these types of data allows exploring in detail how social actions are  accomplished in  situ ,  that  is,  in  real  time  during  an interaction, for example, how diagnosis or possible treatment negotiations are accomplished. There is also limited research on inter-professional communication in mental health contexts which could examine the linguistic repertoires of professional practices, professional ethos, and how diagnoses or treatment recommendations are negotiated inter-professionally, among other issues. Research cited  in  this  editorial  mostly  comes  from  Anglophone contexts. Research from 'global peripheries' [32] remains scarce. While there are a few exceptions, more research from other geographical contexts is called for [33].

To conclude, there are ample opportunities for transdisciplinary  research  that  brings  together  expertise  in psychology,  psychiatry  and  sociolinguistics.  While  discursive  psychology,  for  example,  has  long  been  concerned with investigating issues pertaining to psychology through  language,  sociolinguistics  offers  more  versatile and nuanced ways of doing it by offering a range of different  approaches  and  methodologies.  In  this  special collection  we  welcome  contributions  that  demonstrate the  value  of  sociolinguistic  research  and  how  it  could enhance existing research and practice in psychology and psychiatry. We invite contributions that draw on diverse empirical  data  from  different  clinical  and  non-clinical contexts and that focus on different mental health conditions.  We  also  welcome  authors  working  in  diverse sociocultural  contexts  whose  work  could  advance  our understanding  of  the  cultural  aspects  present  in  discourses of mental health and stigma. It is through such trans-disciplinary effort that we can challenge the existing social practices and ideologies of mental health and ultimately  contribute  to  addressing  some  long-standing societal  issues  of  discrimination  and  stigmatization  of people with mental health issues.
